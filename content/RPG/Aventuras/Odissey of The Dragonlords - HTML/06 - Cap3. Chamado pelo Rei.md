        <p>King Acastus has learned that the Heroes of the Prophecy have completed the first of their Great Labors. He has dispatched seven of his most loyal centurions to find the heroes and bring them before his throne, and the people of the great city of Mytros eagerly await the arrival of the famed heroes. Tales of their great exploits already circulate in every tavern: it is even rumored that they travel in the company of the gods!</p>

            <p>This chapter introduces major characters and includes critical story developments. Run this part of the adventure after the heroes have completed two or three of their Great Labors. The king's centurions might intercept the heroes on the roads of the Heartlands or in the city of Estoria.</p>

            <p>In the distant skies, you can make out three winged forms approaching you. The sun shimmers off their scales, and you realize that they are young copper dragons. You have heard rumors of the dragons of Mytros, but these creatures are far more splendid than you imagined. The dragons are ridden by red-cloaked knights: high ranking centurions from the city. The dragons descend and touch down several dozen yards away. Three knights with shields and swords dismount and approach you. The determined look in their eyes suggests that they have been sent here with a mission, but they clearly mean you no harm. Their leader steps forward and introduces himself, "I am Tarchon. We have come on behalf of King Acastus to escort you to his palace. He wishes an audience with you."</p>
            <div class="float-clear">
                <p></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Tarchon</strong> (NG @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain}) is accompanied by two other captains. They are mounted on @UUID[Actor.QBpQf4GZ4nwwWBe1]{young copper dragons}. He explains that the Lord of Storms has waylaid the city of Mytros with a devastating hurricane. King Acastus expects the heroes to come to the city's aid at once.</p>
        <p>Tarchon and his men have been ordered not to return without the heroes. However, they won't attack the party, even if provoked. If the heroes refuse to come with him, Tarchon will appeal to the party's sense of honor and duty. He also confesses that Acastus is not a forgiving king; if the knights return empty-handed, he will be punished.</p>
        <p>Tarchon is one of a burgeoning order of dragon-mounted soldiers commanded by the king. They call themselves Dragonlords, after the king's ancestors. Kyrah and the other gods are dismissive of this new order, calling it an exercise in pure vanity.</p>

            <p>Traveling to Mytros takes about one day from most of the outer reaches of the Heartlands. You may choose to run one @UUID[RollTable.N6Iw2MNaGWIfoEYY]{random land encounter} during this time. If Tarchon and his men are present, they will leave all the dangerous work to the heroes. They have no wish to risk harm to their dragons.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="574"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Royal Gate</span></h2>
                <p>This massive gate can be accessed from the paved road that snakes up the hillside. The road is wide enough to accommodate traffic moving in both directions. The towers that flank the gate are carved to represent the writhing forms of dozens of dragons.</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">

                    <p>As you approach the city of Mytros, you are reminded of its immense scale. Its walls and temples sprawl across the foundations of Mount Volkan, and its great harbor stretches for miles across the coast. This is the jewel of Thylea: the bastion of mortal civilization.</p>
                    <p>But something is wrong. Massive, swirling black clouds loom over the city, the wind battering its ships and tearing at its banners. Howling gales greet you as your draw closer to the city gates, and it becomes difficult just to put one foot in front of another. The centurions at the Royal Gate urgently beckon you into the city as torrential rain hammers down.</p>
                    <p>Glancing up into the sky, you notice that something ominous has materialized within the spinning eye of the hurricane. It's the scowling visage of Sydon, Lord of Storms. His angry eyes rove the city, until they abruptly lock onto your exact position. The titan conjures a crackling white bolt of lightning and hurls it at you.</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">
                        <p></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Have the heroes roll for initiative. Whoever rolls the lowest is immediately struck by the bolt of lightning, which hits with the same effects as a @UUID[Item.TeRzT0AMTpPY2LkS]{lightning bolt} spell. The chosen hero still gets a saving throw versus the spell. You may choose to have Sydon throw a second bolt at the hero with the second lowest initiative. After the lightning strikes, the storm continues, but Sydon's face can no longer be seen in the clouds.</p>

                <p>Now that the heroes are in the city, Tarchon escorts them straight to the Great Palace, preventing them from stopping along the way. He explains that once the king's dilemma has been resolved, the party will be free to wander and explore the palace and city.</p>

                    <p>At this point, you may choose to allow the heroes to explore the City of Mytros, but the storms make it difficult to do much of anything beyond visit local landmarks. Most people are locked down inside to wait out the storm, and the Great Games cannot begin until the storms end. Tarchon and his centurions will urge the heroes to come to the Great Palace as soon as possible.</p>

The king is always protected by seven of his best centurions (LG @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains}). He is usually accompanied by his concubine <strong>Bella</strong> (CN @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}).

                <p>Centurions escort you through marble colonnades of the palace and into the Royal Hall, where the king waits. Rain hammers loudly upon the palace roof and, as you enter the throne room, an ear-splitting crack of thunder rolls across the sky.</p>
                <p>A middle-aged man with a powerful build sits on a gilded throne opposite the entrance. On the step below him are four others: a beautiful ageless woman of regal bearing, a soldier dressed in a cerulean cloak, a tiefling wearing a black robe, and a finely-dressed young woman. Centurions stand at attention along the walls of the room.</p>

His plan has finally come to fruition, for his heroes discovered a cache of dragon eggs and the lair of an adult silver named Icarus. Acastus claims that Icarus has befriended him, and the dragon wishes to help him rebuild the order.</p>

                <p>Secretly, Acastus knows that every possible course of action will be considered controversial by the people of Mytros, and he does not want to be held responsible for any consequences. He wants the heroes to make the decision, so that they will be blamed rather than him. In summary, here are the options that the heroes must choose from:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Cast the 8th level spell @UUID[Item.ouELOSxkyCDRMHrw]{control weather}.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Order the destruction of the Temple of the Five.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Purchase 10,000 gp worth of livestock to sacrifice.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Convince the gods to work a miracle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whichever solution the heroes choose, the king will order it done immediately. If the chosen action is successful, Sydon will be appeased or his magic will be countered. In either case, the storms will pass.</p>
                <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="581"><span class="entry-title-inner">Option 1: King Acastus</span></h3>
                    <p>First, the king wonders whether the heroes can <strong>stop the storm with magic.</strong> He has heard that there are powerful spells that may be used to alter the weather. Surely if the rumors about the heroes are true, then they should be mighty enough to command such magic?</p>
                    <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset ">
                        <h4 class="entry-title-inner"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="582">Controlling the Weather</span></h4>
                        <p><span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p88</span></p>
                        <p>Acastus refers to the 8th level spell @UUID[Item.ouELOSxkyCDRMHrw]{control weather}, which the heroes probably cannot cast. However, if the party has collected two sets of nymph-hair strings, then they can craft the Boreal harp at the Mithral Forge. In this case, a bard will be capable of casting the spell, but Acastus is impatient, so the harp must have been created before they answer the summons to Mytros.</p>
                        <div class="float-clear">
                            <p></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>When it becomes clear that the heroes cannot use magic, the king feigns disappointment. If the heroes chose not to sacrifice the great boar to Sydon earlier in the story, Acastus may also wonder aloud at their wisdom in making such a decision.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="583"><span class="entry-title-inner">Option 2: Commander Gaius</span></h3>
                    <p>Gaius angrily demands that the king <strong>dismantle the Temple of the Five</strong> and smash every stone to dust. Sydon abhors the worship of other gods, and especially worship of the Five. Gaius has argued for decades that the Temple of the Five should be destroyed, but the idea has recently gained some popular support. If Gaius is to be believed, smashing the temple is the only way to appease the Lord of Storms.</p>
                    <p>Gaius is also contemptuous of both the heroes and Queen Vallus. She is, after all, one of the Five Gods and the daughter of the patron god of the city. As the commander of the Order of Sydon, Gaius believes that the city must abandon its worship of the Five, and stop putting any faith in these "puppets of the Oracle."</p>

                        <p><span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p89</span></p>
                        <p>If the heroes choose to order the destruction of the Temple of the Five, then the gods will grudgingly accept this course of action. Vallus and Kyrah have long believed that it was inevitable that their power would wane and that the people of Mytros would lose faith, but they had hoped that it would not happen in such a fashion. However, this loss of worship still causes pain to the Five. As a result of the temple's destruction, Kyrah, Vallus, Pythor, and Volkan will become dispirited and suffer one level of permanent &Reference[condition=exhaustion].</p>

                    <p>Chondrus argues that Sydon can only be placated by the intervention of Lutheria, his sister-wife. To gain her help the king should <strong>order seventy children of the city to "take the black robes"</strong> and dedicate themselves to the Cult of Lutheria. He promises that the Lady of Dreams will treat the children well—they will eat the finest of foods and drink the sweetest of wines.</p>
                    <p>In fact, they will all be sacrificed in the cult's perverse blood rituals. Everyone suspects this and hates the suggestion. Queen Vallus would have Chondrus killed before she would allow it to happen.</p>

Normally, the priests of Sydon sacrifice dozens of animals to placate the storm god. Acastus explains that for a storm like this one, they would need to <strong>perform a hecatomb, a sacrifice of 100 oxen.</strong> This would require half the livestock in the city, and it would cost about 10,000 gp. Perhaps the heroes might pay the cost? The royal coffers cannot afford such an expense...</p>

                        <p>"Heroes of the Prophecy, I greet you. I am Vallus, of the Five Gods. For centuries, the people of Mytros have revered me as the goddess of wisdom.

                <p>Hours pass, and the storm gradually relents. Light breaks through the breaking clouds, spilling down onto the marble pediments and wet paving stones of the city.

                <p>"This map will lead you to the last known whereabouts of the <em>Ultros.</em> It was my ancestor's ship, the legendary vessel of Estor Arkelander, fiercest of the Dragonlords. There was a time when I thought I might claim it for myself, but I have no need of it now."</p>
                <p>"You should know that I am rebuilding the ancient order of the Dragonlords. In time, I will have a legion of dragon-mounted warriors under my command.

            <p>Acastus encourages the heroes to leave his city as soon as possible, because their fame has begun to overshadow his own. Secretly, he will pray to Sydon that his bloodthirsty undead ancestor will kill the heroes and put an end to their glory-hogging ways.</p>
            <p>If the heroes ask why they must recover the <em>Ultros</em> instead of sailing some other ship, Acastus explains, truthfully, that the wrath of Sydon makes travel beyond the coast nearly impossible. They will need a legendary ship if they are to survive the journey.</p>

                <p>Vallus explains that her husband has not been entirely honest with the party. The map to the <em>Ultros</em> is accurate, but the king is almost certainly sending the heroes to their doom. She knows that Acastus has been troubled in his sleep by dreams of some kind, and she thinks that his unusual generosity is somehow connected to this. He would never give the heroes such a gift unless he believed that it would work to his advantage.</p>
                <p>Vallus insists that when the heroes have acquired the Ultros, they should return to her immediately. She is certain that her 'stupid husband' will try to take the ship. She feels that nothing good can come of Acastus controlling both the ship and the dragons.</p>

She has some suspicions about what the Titans want. You can decide if your players need to hear anything of the history of the Titans at this point, or whether this would only muddy the waters for them. She is desperately worried that, at the time when the Oath of Peace ends, the powers of the Five Gods will be fully spent. If Pythor or Kyrah are present, she will also be concerned for them, and will make a point of asking after the health of Volkan, her father.</p>

                    <p>Vallus asks the heroes for a favor. Sydon may have been pacified this time, but the Titans should pay a price for their cruelty and impudence. While attacking the Temple of Sydon would be too much of a provocation, the Cult of Lutheria is gaining a dangerous amount of influence in the city.

                    <p>The queen suggests that the heroes should investigate the <em>Temple of Lutheria</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m20.-temple-of-lutheria]{M20}) in <em>Stygian Row</em>.

            <h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="606"><span class="entry-title-inner">The City of Mytros</span></h1>
            <p>The City of Mytros Founded five centuries ago, Mytros is named after the matriarch of the Five Gods—the Goddess of Dawn, who is also called the 'Silver Queen.' She is the patron goddess of the city, although her influence has waned somewhat in recent centuries.</p>
            <p>The city was built around a natural harbor, where trade ships arrive with goods from the distant city of Aresia. Two great bronze colossi once guarded the harbor, but only one of them is still standing. The city's silhouette is dominated by several massive temples.</p>
            <p>The hills above the harbor provide views that reach as far as the Mithral Mountains and the Oldwoods. These two hills are where the most important buildings are located. One hill is the religious and political center of the city, while the other hill is its mercantile center. Between the hills are slums known as Stygian Row. Behind the city is Mount Volkan, an extinct volcano named after the husband of Mytros.</p>
            <p>Mytros is mostly a beautiful and clean city. The streets are cleaned every night, and the citizens frown upon those who allow their mounts to defecate in the streets. The city houses close to 50,000 people and, although the majority of the population are human, Mytros is the most diverse city in Thylea, with every race represented.</p>
            <p>Many of the greatest structures in the city are built entirely from marble, inlaid with bronze, adorned with painted tiles and beautiful mosaics. During the day, the heat of the sun can make the city seem like a mirage, as the air shimmers and the buildings glitter from the reflected sunlight. Great walls surround and protect the city, with only two major entry points—the <em>Royal Gate</em> and the <em>Commerce Gate</em>.</p>

                <p>Vallus has been the queen of Mytros for centuries, but she is far removed from her people. As the goddess of wisdom, she is viewed as the natural successor to Mytros, her mother, and her right to rule is affirmed by the Temple of the Five. However, as the Oath of Peace fails, faith in the Five Gods has waned, and people are growing restless with anxiety about the Titans.</p>

                <p>Acastus has been the king of Mytros ever since he persuaded Vallus to marry him, some twenty years ago. He is extremely popular in the city, especially since he obtained a huge silver dragon. The blood of Estor Arkelander flows in his veins, and many view him as the successor of the ancient Dragonlords. Most believe him to be a strong and wise ruler, or else why would Vallus have married him?</p>

                <p>The Order of Sydon are devout worshippers of the Lord of Storms. Although the Titan sent hurricanes to punish the city for its faith in the Five Gods, a surprising number of people worship him and support the Order. Commander Gaius is often seen flying over the city on his silver dragon, and he's a popular figure with young men and women who dream of joining the Order.</p>

                <p>The Cult of the Snake are known for their abiding loyalty to a mysterious figure called the Lady of Coins. Those who displease the Lady are often found turned to stone, with a green snake painted on a nearby wall. The Cult of the Snake is actually a thieves' guild, and hence its influence is covert rather than open. Most of the thieves in the city are loyal to the Lady.</p>

                <p>The Cult of Lutheria is the oldest cult in Mytros. The cultists are unabashed worshippers of the Lady of Dreams. Most people find their beliefs and rituals to be repugnant, but they are tolerated because they provide wine and entertainment for the popular wine festivals. In truth, they would have been ejected from the city a long time ago, except that they have "friends in high places"—devotees among the aristocracy.</p>

                    <p>You stumble upon a melancholy scene. Dozens of figures dressed in black robes march somberly down the street in an orderly procession. Mourners line the street: wailing spouses, dumbstruck children, and resigned elders look on. A large bronze cage is held aloft towards the front of the procession. Inside the cage is a shackled minotaur.</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">
                        <p></p>

                </div>
                <p>This is a funeral procession for a dozen centurions killed fighting the centaur tribes on the borders of civilization. The women wail in an ostentatious display of grief for the dead while children look on dumbstruck and slightly scared by the caged beast.</p>
                <p>The caged @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{Minotaur} is for a ritual battle before the funeral. Most citizens of Mytros consider minotaurs to be murderous brutes, fit only for use in games and rituals. They are sometimes captured by slavers and forced into oaths of servitude.</p>
                <p>Once they've been exhausted by years of forced labor, they are entered into gladiatorial games, where most of them are eventually slaughtered. Refer to the <em>Minotaur Market</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m21.-the-minotaur-market]{M21}) for details about this dark stain on the culture of the city.</p>
                <p>The procession stops just outside of the <em>Royal Gate</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m6.-the-royal-gate]{M6}), where a group of pyres has been lit for the dead soldiers. Nearby, a walled pen has been constructed for the funerary games. A group of three @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{soldiers}, family members of the deceased, will be chosen to fight the minotaur. A @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{Priest} of Sydon announces that the sacrifice of the minotaur is a blessing for the dead.</p>

                    <p>Before you stands an imposing structure supported by carved stone columns. A series of steps carved to resemble crashing waves leads to the temple's entrance. Inside is an enormous central statue made of blue-green marble. It depicts a tall, wrathful man with three eyes and long gray hair. He wields an onyx black glaive. This is Sydon, the Lord of Storms.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This temple is the primary place of worship for Sydon in all of Thylea. The temple itself is a <em>peripteros</em> with 48 columns. It is built on a high podium that is accessed by an imposing set of steps shaped like ocean waves.</p>
                <p>A stair at the center of the temple leads to several underground chambers where the paladins of Sydon meet to discuss the Order's many plans.</p>
                <p>The Order of Sydon are headquartered here. They are a band of zealots who revere the ocean god Sydon above all others. They seek to the end all worship of the Five.</p>
                <p>During the day, the temple is filled with citizens who come to hear the teachings of Sydon or receive blessings from the priests. During these busy periods, at least three @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{priests} of Sydon with six @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains} as protectors can be found within. At night, the temple proper is quiet, although the underground chambers are occupied by priests and soldiers.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="624"><span class="entry-title-inner">Gaius and His Dragon</span></h3>
                    <p>The highest-ranking member of the Order of Sydon is the paladin, @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#commander-gaius]{Commander Gaius}. During the day, he can often be found in the <em>Great Palace</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m4.-the-great-palace]{M4}), but at night he is usually here. Gaius is a true believer—a zealot who knows that the Five are false gods, thieves who stole the power of the true god, Sydon.</p>
                    <p>According to Gaius, the Five are useless pretenders: Pythor is a carousing drunkard; Kyrah composes terrible poetry; Vallus preens herself in an ivory tower; and Volkan is a crazy old dwarf who builds useless trinkets.</p>
                    <p>Once the heroes sail into the Cerulean Gulf on the <em>Ultros</em>, Gaius will move to the Island of Yonder, where the Order of Sydon have a base. Gaius is able to move between Yonder and Mytros easily due to a gift given to him by Sydon: <strong>Argyn</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.IlO2sLaK4hfJnCtJ]{Young Silver Dragon}).</p>
                    <p>Argyn was bred by Sydon at his tower, <em>Praxys</em> (S25). The dragon has been conditioned to believe that the Five are evil and that Sydon is the one and only force for good in the world. Argyn's presence in the city is the subject of widespread gossip and admiration, but the dragon's very existence infuriates Queen Vallus.</p>

                    <p>This relatively humble temple has an entrance with five stone columns. While it is smaller than the Temple of Sydon, it displays a much higher level of artistry, boasting lofty architecture and beautiful statuary. Intricate carvings embellish nearly every surface, complete with gilding and inlaid precious stones throughout.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This temple is the oldest civic building in Mytros. Elected representatives from the city districts of Mytros and the outlying villages meet in council here every new moon. However, the structure of civic life is increasingly dictated by the Order of Sydon, who believe that the Temple of the Five should be destroyed in order to appease the jealousy of the Lord of Storms.</p>
                <p>Queen Vallus often visits here. During the day, she can be found at the palace, where she runs the city's civic affairs. She comes here at night to pray to her mother, Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn.</p>
                <p>The temple is tended by five high priests (LG @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{priests}) and each high priest is attended by five @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{acolytes}. The priests provide all common temple services at no charge, including the @spell[lesser restoration|lesser] and @UUID[Item.CrfqCBjK8JdTHLqD]{greater restoration} spells.</p>

                    <p>Outside of the temple during the day is a gang of young men who are admirers of Vallus. They are led by a vain young man named Sulla (LN @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{Acolyte}), the youngest son of the powerful merchant, Taran Neurdagon.</p>
                    <p>Sulla is enamored with Vallus, and spends all of his time trying to gain an audience with the goddess or catch a glimpse of her as she leaves the temple. Vallus finds the young man obnoxious. She ignores him entirely, much to his chagrin. The last time he tried to gain her attention, Vallus told him that she would agree to have an audience with him if he brought her a single mortal of unsurpassed beauty and wisdom.</p>
                    <p>Sulla has heard of the heroes' exploits. He will single out the hero with the highest Charisma score and another with the highest Wisdom score. He begs the two heroes to accompany him to see Vallus. If the party agrees, then Sulla will take them directly to the queen.</p>
                    <p>Vallus is amused by the fact that the heroes have been roped in by Sulla, but she will humor them. Sulla presents the two heroes and extolls their beauty and wisdom, hoping to impress her. Vallus remains unmoved, pointing out the heroes' various flaws.</p>
                    <p>This forces Sulla into the realm of hyperbole—the heroes are the wisest, most beautiful creatures ever to grace the city! Vallus reluctantly agrees, until finally, Sulla's unrequited affections have been completely transferred from the queen to the heroes.</p>
                    <p>Sulla proposes marriage to each of the heroes, offering a gold ring inset with a diamond worth 1,000 gp. Whichever hero agrees to marry the young man gets the ring. The agreement is not binding, but this entire situation greatly amuses the queen.</p>

                    <p>The Great Palace stands at the top of an impressive stone stairway. It is similar in appearance to the temples of the gods, except that its design emphasizes its civic function. Rather than statues to the gods, the palace is decorated with royal seals and with bronze tablets describing the legal codes of the city.</p>

                <p>While not nearly as grand as the city's temples, this palace is still an impressive building. The stairs lead to an expansive antechamber, which connects to the throne room in the Royal Hall.

                <p>The heroes are summoned here when they first arrive in the city. King Acastus is usually accompanied by his advisor, @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#chondrus]{Chondrus} (see appendix), his concubine <strong>Bella</strong> (CN @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}), and @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#commander-gaius]{Gaius}, commander of the Order of Sydon (see appendix).

                    <p>The sprawling campus grounds of the Academy bustle with activity. Over a dozen impressive marble buildings stand in rows, connected by paved, well-maintained pathways.

                <p>The Academy is spread throughout more than a dozen buildings. This is one of the greatest centers of learning not just in Thylea but most likely in all the world.</p>
                <p><em><strong>The Great Library</strong></em> contains scrolls detailing knowledge on the flora and fauna of Thylea as well as information on topics such as metallurgy, alchemy, medicine, cartography, and almost any other imaginable subject.</p>
                <p><em><strong>The Hall of Heroes</strong></em> is devoted to recording the heroic exploits of Thylea's heroes throughout the ages. Marble statues and busts of all of Thylea's heroes can be found here as well as scrolls of their histories and songs.</p>
                <p><em><strong>The Schools of the Arcane</strong></em> consist of eight buildings devoted to the study of the eight schools of magic, each headed by an arcane master (LN @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{mages}).</p>
                <p><em><strong>The Great Orrery</strong></em> is a building that contains a replica of the many planes of existence, represented as celestial spheres fashioned from bronze clockwork.</p>
                <p><em><strong>The Hall of Debate</strong></em> provides a forum where any philosophy can be discussed without repercussions, even if it veers into the theological. Some of the greatest minds in Thylea can be found debating philosophy here:</p>

                    <li class="rd__li "><strong>Machaon</strong> (CG half-orc @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage})</li>

                    <p>The heroes are invited to participate in a series of philosophical debates at the <em>Hall of Debate.</em> Machaon, Chalcodon, Kerodotos, and Atreus all wish to test the intellectual mettle of the so-called "Saviors of Thylea."</p>
                    <p>Each of the philosophers poses a paradoxical problem to the heroes and then awaits a response. There are no right answers to these puzzles: the philosophers want to see how the heroes behave in the debate. They will be impressed if the heroes take the exercise seriously. They will be disappointed if the heroes are sarcastic or silly in their responses.</p>

                        <p>The famed ship that brought the Dragonlord Adonis Neurdagon from the old lands to the lands of Thylea was the <em>Valorous.</em> The <em>Valorous</em> had sixty oars, a single mast, and a great prow. Over the centuries, it has decayed, and the Neurdagon family removed the old oars and planks, replacing it with newer and stronger timber. They replaced the mast when it was cracked in a storm, and they replaced the prow when the ship ran aground. After five centuries, every single piece of the <em>Valorous</em> has been replaced.</p>

                        <p>Pythor is in a footrace with a tortoise. Pythor allows the tortoise a head start of 300 feet. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Pythor will have run 300 feet, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance of only 30 feet. It will then take Pythor some further time to catch up to those additional 30 feet, by which time the tortoise will have moved even farther ahead. It takes more time for Pythor to reach the third point, while the tortoise continues to maintain his lead...</p>

                        <p>Thus, whenever Pythor arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can catch the tortoise, despite running much faster. Clearly, this means that Pythor will never catch the tortoise. How do you explain this paradox?</p>

                        <p>A sphinx captures the young crown prince of Mytros. His mother comes to the sphinx and pleads for the return of her son. The sphinx replies that he will only return the prince safely if the mother can guess correctly whether or not he will indeed return the boy.</p>

                        <p>What is the problem here? As it turns out, there is no problem if the mother guesses that the sphinx will return him: if she is right, the boy is returned; if she is wrong, the sphinx keeps him.</p>
                        <p>However, if she answers that the sphinx will not return him, we end up with a paradox: if she is right and the sphinx never intended to return her child, then the sphinx has to return him, but in doing so, he breaks his word and contradicts the mother's answer. On the other hand, if she is wrong and the sphinx actually did intend to return the boy, then the sphinx must keep him, even though he did not intend to do so, thereby also breaking his word.</p>

                        <p>What is the nature of good and evil? Are they metaphysical properties that can be measured or changed? For example, if a man commits murder, his neighbors may call him evil. We may rightly say that he has evil properties. Hoping to atone for his act, this man may offer to pay the victim's family gold pieces to compensate for their loss. Now, let us say that the victim's family is satisfied by the payment, and they forgive him, saying that he is no longer evil. The man had evil properties before he made the payment, but now he does not.</p>

                    <p>Zorin spent years perfecting his potions, but all his teachers cared about were oratory skills. Unfortunately for him, he has a habit of insulting his audience in any long conversation. He opened his shop when it became clear that he had no future as a famous philosopher.</p>

                    <p>When Taran eventually appears, he explains his predicament to the heroes. The Lady of Coins is a self-styled folk hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor of <em>Stygian Row</em>. She has an intense hatred for the minotaur slave trade and aggressively attacks those who try to make an honest profit. Taran admits that he makes a large portion of his wealth from the minotaur slave trade, so his business suffers more than most.</p>
                    <p>Taran explains that the Lady is cursed—she is a medusa who petrifies anyone who crosses her. Further, he explains that minotaurs are violent beasts with limited intelligence who revel in bloodshed, and the fact that the Lady of Coins has an affinity for them speaks volumes about her character. Taran also suspects that she is behind the Cult of the Snake, a thieves' guild deeply involved with smuggling and murder.</p>

This corpulent halfling is sometimes called "Vitalis the Fat"or "Vitalis the Fragrant"(although never to his face). Many believe him to be the wisest mortal in Mytros. Vitalis lives, sleeps, and eats in the gardens, and he is well-fed by his many admirers.</p>
                <p>However, his personal habits don't seem particularly wise, as he never cleans himself, and he dresses in rags.</p>
                <p>He also flatulates, belches, and harasses everyone who passes by. Some of his favorite insults include:</p>

                    <li class="rd__li ">Mirrors reveal many things, but they cannot talk... and lucky for you, they can't laugh, either!</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">You there! Turn around. Hmmm... I can tell that you're a centaur, but all I can see is the rear end!</li>

                <p>The harbor of Mytros is as grand as the rest of the city. You see ships sailing in and out of the bay, while others remain tied up at docks. On one side of the harbor stands an immense bronze statue of a muscular man. It's clear that another such colossus once stood opposite this one, but it now lies in ruins.</p>

                    <p>This bronze colossus is recognizable as a young version of Pythor, God of Battle and current King of Estoria. The statue's head is wreathed by a crown of leaves. Despite its relaxed stance and serene gaze, the statue seems alert to anything that might threaten the city.</p>

                <p>This colossus was destroyed two centuries ago, and the tale is still told with horror by the people of Mytros. The Kraken, a terrifying creature from the Forgotten Sea, attacked the city during a powerful storm. The twin colossi wrestled the creature back into the ocean, but the Colossus of Mytros was torn apart in the struggle. She returned to her guard post and collapsed into ruin.</p>

                                <p>As you enter, a beautiful siren dressed in a scarlet toga approaches you. "Welcome to the <em>Siren's Roost.</em> Here, you can taste the finest fruits of immortality. How may we serve you?"</p>

She genuinely seeks to entertain her guests with fine music, wine, and "interesting"company. Unlike similar establishments, she does not discriminate against satyrs, minotaurs, or centaurs, but she does prefer to entertain rich clients and famous heroes.</p>
                            <p>When engaged in longer conversations, Ambrosia makes it clear that she despises Julius, the owner of <em>The Satyr's Tail</em>, who used to send thugs to collect "protection"money. Now, she employs <strong>Vorena</strong> (LN half-orc @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain}), a taciturn former centurion, to protect her establishment. Vorena does her job well.</p>
                            <p>Each of Ambrosia's escorts claims to trace their lineage to a god or a nymph, so that clients can pick their preferred flavor of "immortality."</p>

He had his own galley before he ran afoul of Cerulean pirates and lost everything, including his left arm. He doesn't like seeing his patrons bothered. If the heroes disturb his regulars, he'll send three of his bouncers (CE @UUID[Actor.RE2KrDh2qupITiSn]{thugs}) to remove them from the premises.</p>

Over a dozen unwashed minotaurs have been locked within the cages. The minotaurs are physically fit but filthy, and many have fresh bruises and superficial cuts from battle.</p>

                                <p>The citizens of Mytros treat minotaurs as little more than livestock, using them as opponents to be slaughtered in the funeral games held to honor the recently deceased. This practice is mirrored and multiplied in the Great Games, which often require hundreds of the creatures. Although some minotaurs used in this manner are captured from tribes in the steppes, others are captively bred for the task. These "domesticated"minotaurs live almost universally in squalid conditions unfit for sentient creatures.</p>
                                <p>Queen Vallus has long sought to end this barbaric practice in the city, but King Acastus and the Order of Sydon have undermined her at every turn. There were a few centuries where minotaurs were merely outlawed from the city, but widespread smuggling and other skullduggery have ensured that the practice of slavery is alive and well.</p>
                                <p>The party may seek to liberate the minotaurs in the market, but it will cause chaos in this district and infuriate the Order of Sydon. The queen would strongly approve of such actions, but most of the district's citizens are cowards who prefer to maintain the status quo.</p>

                            <p>The process can be ended at any time by pulling either lever to the off position, which immediately drains the chamber and opens the doors. When the liquid is being heated, the only other way to open the doors is to use a knock spell or to succeed at a DC 30 Strength check to force them. If the doors are opened in any way, the process ends and the room immediately drains.</p>
                            <p>Two @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{minotaurs} wait on the east side of the chamber, watching for intruders. They wait until at least two visible intruders are inside the acid chamber. Then they move outside to pull the emergency lever. Anyone outside of the chamber at the west end will see the emergency lever move into the "ON"position, the doors will seal, and they can clearly see what is happening to their companions through the porthole.</p>
                            <p>Heroes outside the chamber can try to pull the lever to the "OFF"position by testing their strength against the minotaurs. The minotaurs have advantage as they are helping each other, but the heroes can do the same. Once the chamber has been re-opened the minotaurs will rush forward to attack.</p>

            <p>The Great Games are a series of athletic competitions between the kingdoms of Thylea. They began four centuries ago—a centennial celebration of the Oath of Peace and the end of the First War. While visiting Mytros, the party has the option to engage in the competition for a chance to win great fame and live up to their calling as the greatest warriors in Thylea.</p>

                    <p>The Games are held every year to honor the Oath of Peace. Dozens of priests offer sacrifices to the Five Gods at the start of the games. The Order of Sydon have recently begun to participate in the Games also, bringing minotaur sacrifices for Sydon and Lutheria.</p>
                    <p>The Games are a political tool used by various factions to demonstrate their dominance. Because of this, the Games are officiated by a neutral party—Versi, the Oracle, whose judgment is respected by all.</p>
                    <p>Akimedes (TN mage), the Academy's arcane Master of Divination attends and watches over every competition to ensure that no one cheats. He wears special bronze goggles that grant him the effects of detect magic and precise vision out to 400 feet. Cheating is penalized by permanent expulsion from the Games.</p>

                    <p>The victors of the Game's events are awarded special medals that are crafted from precious metals. These medals hold enormous value to collectors, but selling them is frowned upon. Nevertheless, many athletes are forced to sell their medals later in life, when they are past their physical prime and coin runs short.</p>
                    <p>Every event awards three medals—one for each of the top three athletes: bronze (250 gp) for third place, adamantine (500 gp) for second place, and mithral (1,000 gp) for first place. Legend has it that the Five Gods competed in the first Great Games, and "good old Pythor won every single medal."</p>

                    <p>Each contestant can choose a partner to magically augment them. This partner is allowed to use any magic available to them. Most of the lesser athletes can't afford magical aid. Those who can afford it are aided by an @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{Acolyte} (who provides the @UUID[Item.J9cyYpoj85HULHak]{bless} spell).</p>
                    <p>Well-known athletes have access to a mage or priest. These spell casters prepare spells such as @UUID[Item.J9cyYpoj85HULHak]{bless}, @UUID[Item.LMCWcb7N5AR5watf]{enhance ability}, @UUID[Item.9G7l5V8Tvd8Eh2Ln]{longstrider}, or @UUID[Item.WNNH69V5hP3HIxqF]{haste}. Partners who target anyone but their chosen athlete are immediately disqualified, as is the athlete that they were aiding.</p>

                        <p>Thyleans decided long ago that trying to stop magic manipulation in the Great Games was pointless, hence the ruling allowing a magical partner to augment an athlete. It also allows heroes that aren't directly involved in a competition to be part of the action.</p>

                    <p>A hero must first succeed in a trial jumping event against four other competitors (LN @UUID[Actor.k9HdrbhMqCYwqdJG]{guards}). Only one of the other competitors will try and jump farther than the standard jump.</p>
                    <p>In the actual jumping competition, the heroes will have to compete against Spira, Leyland, Hatria and Egan. A competitor can choose to perform a standard jump, which will result in a long jump that is equivalent to the Strength score of the competitor.</p>
                    <p>However, a competitor can also try to go further than the standard jump. This requires a DC 15 Athletics check. Failure means that the competitor lands 1-4 (1d4) ft. short of the standard jump distance. A success adds 1 ft., with an additional 1 ft. for every 3 points rolled above 15 (e.g. DC 18, DC 21, etc).

On its back rides a crowned figure, cloaked in red. The spectators cheer in unison. "It's King Acastus! King Acastus has come to honor the victors of the Great Games!"</p>
                    <p>The silver dragon touches down at the center of the colosseum, and the king dismounts with a flourish, waving to the crowd with a broad smile. He carries several shiny medals in one hand, and a crown of laurels in the other.

            <p>King Acastus has given the heroes a map to the <em>Ultros</em>, the legendary ship captained by his ancestor, Estor Arkelander. Acastus claims that his scouts have sighted the ship at the Dead Falls. In fact, he has long known the ship's location, because his ancestor's ghost haunts his dreams. Estor hopes to lure one of his mortal descendants to the <em>Ultros</em> so that he may possess a warrior's body and take vengeance upon the Titans.</p>

                <p>The time has come to complete the next of your Great Labors. King Acastus gave you a map to the last known whereabouts of the legendary Ultros, but its location seems ominous. The ship was last seen near the Dead Falls in the rocky wastelands of the eastern Heartlands.</p>
                <p>You've heard stories of the Ultros. It was captained by Estor Arkelander the Dragonlord, leader of a savage and bloodthirsty crew. He savaged the islands of Thylea, leaving slaughter in his wake. Sydon unleashed his full fury against the vessel, attempting to smash it with hundred-foot waves and drag it down to the bottom of the sea with terrifying whirlpools. But the magic of the Ultros was so powerful that even the Lord of Storms could not sink it.</p>
                <p>The ship and its crew went missing several years after the end of the First War. You must find it and take command of it, for you cannot brave the waters of the Forgotten Sea without it.</p>

                <p>Estor Arkelander's ghost is captain of the <em>Ultros</em>. Seventy ghosts and specters are the crew under his command, all of them Estor's thanes. The specters are crewmen who have lost their sanity and been reduced to soulless undead shades with no personality or drive.</p>
                <p>Estor has been waiting for a band of warriors to board his ship. He wants a new body, and possessing a great hero will do nicely. For years, he has tried to lure King Acastus to his ship, but his descendant is a cowardly disappointment. He knows that Acastus has sent the heroes in his place, and he plans to haunt their dreams to discover the worthiest amongst them. He will mark the worthiest hero as the warrior he intends to possess.</p>
                <p>The <em>Ultros</em> is usually docked in an inlet near the Dead Falls. Rarely, it ventures northward along the River Lethe. The ghostly crew of the <em>Ultros</em> are deathly afraid of the horrors of the Nether Sea, but they are nevertheless drawn to the chasm at the Dead Falls. The necromantic energy from the Nether Sea makes them feel almost alive again.</p>

Anyone who spills over the edge will fall for 20 seconds before colliding with the primordial waters of the Nether Sea, suffering 70 ([[/damage 20d6 type=bludgeoning]]) damage.</p>
                    <p>The secret inlet is shown on the king's map, but its location is not obvious at first glance. With some trivial investigation, the heroes will discover a switchback rocky passage that leads to the inlet. The passage is flooded by water (5 ft. deep), which the heroes must wade or swim through.</p>

                            <p>You discover an inlet near the chasm where the river's waters are eerily still.

                            <p>This ship is large, and of fine workmanship, though its design is ancient. Its sails are black, and the prow is carved into the likeness of a dragon. You see no crew aboard and you hear only silence.</p>

Once Davos is destroyed, the specters return to their duties. Davos starts off the battle by tearing the flesh from his face in order to use his <em>horrifying visage</em>. After that, he tries to possess one of the heroes.</p>

                        <p>A fully-crewed ship like the Ultros should have had 150 men. The remaining oarsmen are strong enough to man one oar each, which means that there are 56 specters on this deck.

                        <p>When the ghost of the last traitorous thane has been destroyed, the fog surrounding the <em>Ultros</em> lifts, and the heroes awaken from the dream. Any heroes who were killed during the dream wake with two levels of &Reference[condition=exhaustion], but they are otherwise fine.</p>

                            <p>The ghost of Estor Arkelander awaits the heroes in the captain's quarters. He is now satisfied that the heroes are stronger than his previous thanes. He chooses the hero who performed most admirably during the trial and appoints them captain. If they refuse the bargain, he grumpily offers it to someone else.</p>

                                <p>"You have all proven yourselves worthy to command this ship. But one of you in particular has shown that you are worthy to be captain. I offer you the honor of being my successor. You will know power beyond anything you could possibly imagine. Do you accept?"</p>

                            <p>Estor's curse prevents him from taking possession of a hero without their consent. This bargain is a trap and, if anyone accepts his offer, Estor immediately takes possession of that hero for the next hour.</p>

                                <p>Accepting the bargain means that the hero's personality immediately changes: they become dangerously cruel and obsessed with achieving immortality, and their alignment shifts to neutral evil. Estor speaks constantly in their mind, always encouraging the pursuit of power at any cost. His goal is to wear down the hero's willpower so that he can eventually take permanent control. Once per day, Estor's spirit can take control of the hero for one round without a chance to save.</p>
                                <p>Eventually, Estor's control over the hero may become permanent (which forces the character to retire as an NPC), but this should only happen if the player's behavior has become too disruptive to the rest of the party.</p>

                            <p>If no one accepts Estor's bargain, then he is confined to the captain's quarters, and he becomes absolutely furious at the party. Anyone who swore the oath to the ship may command it. One hero should be elected or chosen to serve as the ship's captain.</p>

                <p>The ship returns to Mytros, where the heroes are received by a crowd of onlookers. News of the arrival of the <em>Ultros</em> has spread through the city like wildfire. The king and queen have also come to meet the heroes.</p>

                    <p>When you arrive back in Mytros, Queen Vallus is waiting for you at the docks, accompanied by her retinue. But before she can greet you, a silver dragon descends from the heavens toward the <em>Ultros</em>. It passes overhead and lands on the docks ahead. King Acastus slides off of the back of the dragon to stand gracefully beside it.</p>
                    <p>"You are great warriors indeed, to have taken command of my ancestor's ship... but the <em>Ultros</em> is a relic from bygone days. To stand up to the power of the Titans, we will need dragons—not ancient ships."</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">
                        <p></p>

                </div>
                <p>King Acastus has come to upstage the party. He is secretly furious that the heroes were not killed by the ghost of his ancestor. He coldly congratulates them on their success and introduces his splendid dragon, Icarus. He emphasizes that the <em>Ultros</em> is an ancient relic—hardly as impressive as his dragons.</p>
                <p>Queen Vallus brushes her husband aside and proclaims that the city of Mytros needs the heroes now more than ever. She frowns and wonders how the <em>Ultros</em> made it to Mytros with no crew. It appears that all of the specters that haunted the ship have vanished.</p>
