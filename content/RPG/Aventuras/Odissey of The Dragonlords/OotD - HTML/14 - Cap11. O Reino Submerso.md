        <p>This chapter begins when the party decides to seek out one of the lost Divine Artifacts—the @item[Promethean Fire|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords]. Recovering this artifact is a major undertaking that requires the party to dive deep beneath the oceans and explore the legendary Sunken Kingdom. There they will meet forgotten gods and face primordial dangers, including the monster Scylla, bane of the ancient seas.</p>

            <p>Before traveling to the Sunken Kingdom, the party will need a map to its location. Pyrrha, a siren from Aresia, has long possessed just such a map. She attends to Narsus in the <em>Chamber of Beauty</em> (A6). Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000013#audience-with-narsus]{Audience with Narsus} in Chapter 10 for details.</p>
            <p>Once the party has obtained the map, they can set out on an expedition to find the sunken city. They will need a crewed ship and some means by which to explore underwater for long periods of time. Aketa at the Merchant Headquarters (A21) in Aresia is willing to provide magic and equipment to assist with the quest. Versi, the Oracle, is also more than willing to assist, as she has long been curious about the sunken city.</p>
            <p>Here is an overview of this chapter:</p>

                        <p>The party must sail to the location of the sunken city, anchor the ship, and dive to the ocean floor. They must speak with the merfolk in the ruins of the city to learn the location of the Promethean Fire. The merfolk are fighting a war against a terrifying merrow tribe.</p>

            <p>The Sunken Kingdom is a city that was swallowed by the ocean, thousands of years ago. It is all that remains of one of Thylea's most powerful and ancient civilizations. The city is the original home of the siren race, and it was once a place of great beauty. But when disaster befell the city, it sank to the floor of the Cerulean Gulf. There are many poems and songs that purport to tell the tale of the city's destruction. The truth is known to only a few.</p>

            <p>The Sunken Kingdom is located a few miles west of Yonder and north of the Island of Exiles.</p>
            <p>The city stretches across a relatively shallow part of the ocean, only a few hundred feet below sea level. Sunlight filters through the water and provides light. The elegant marble architecture of the sirens has been amazingly resilient, despite centuries under the ocean. Coral has grown over many sections of the city, adding to its ethereal beauty.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1743"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Forgotten Gods</span></h2>
            <p>The city is no longer populated by sirens. It is now the domain of a merfolk kingdom. The merfolk worship a group of powerful godlike beings that are seemingly trapped in the ancient temple ruins of the city. While these 'gods' are unable to grant spells, they do perform feats of magic for the merfolk and grant them magical items as rewards. The godlike beings are singularly focused on retrieving something that was lost at the bottom of a great rift in the center of the city. This rift is known as the Chasm, and it is the domain of a terrifying creature called Scylla.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1744"><span class="entry-title-inner">War for the Ruins</span></h2>
            <p>In recent years, the Sunken Kingdom has been ravaged by war. A century ago, a tribe of merfolk descended into the Chasm at the request of their gods. They never returned and were presumed to have been eaten by Scylla. A few years ago, the tribe miraculously emerged from the Chasm, but in a form that was unrecognizable to the merfolk. They were now merrow: twisted, malevolent versions of merfolk. The creatures immediately went to war against the merfolk. Their motives are unclear, but they are known to throw some of the bodies of their victims into the depths of the Chasm.</p>

                <p>The merfolk kingdom is the largest underwater civilization in all of Thylea. There are thousands of merfolk that live in and amongst the ruins of the Sunken Kingdom. The city is able to support such numbers due to the vast forests of kelp and coral.</p>
                <p>Alongside the merfolk is a tribe of nereid that tend to the coral and kelp forests. They are fiercely protective of these natural wonders and often join the merfolk in battle against the merrow.</p>

                <p>The merrow are sadistic predators that live to kill and cause mayhem. Unbeknownst to the merfolk, the merrow were twisted by the evil beast known as Scylla that dwells at the bottom of the Chasm. They now serve to provide her with food. For this purpose they hunt merfolk, whales, dolphins and other mammalian sea creatures. Those that they don't devour themselves they discard into the Chasm. Several sea hag covens have come to serve the merrow warlord.</p>

                            <p>When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</p>

                            <p>Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss targets beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a thrown weapon (javelins, spears, tridents, darts, etc.)</p>

                <p>Treat this part of the adventure like an expedition into uncharted underwater territory. The party should bring a ship and a crew, with 1 mile mithral chains for hauling up treasure.

                    <p>As you descend into the murky depths of the ocean, a glorious city slowly emerges through the dimly lit waters. Towers, spires, domes and other magnificent structures are spread out across the ocean floor in a sprawling metropolis, still largely intact despite centuries beneath the waves. The basic architecture of the city has been overgrown with brightly colored coral that only accentuates the sunken city's beauty.</p>
                    <p>On the southeast edge of the city, however, is a dark, gaping maw: an open chasm that extends deep into the ocean floor, swallowing up all light that enters.</p>

                    <p>Wielding tridents and nets, the merfolk fight valiantly against their twisted brethren, but the merrow are bigger, stronger, and far more savage. Several of the merfolk are already badly wounded, with plumes of their blood slowly seeping into the surrounding waters.</p>
                    <p>Unaware of the interlopers, one of the evil merfolk plunges a long spear into the belly of a hapless mermaid soldier, who cries out and clutches feebly at the thick shaft now protruding from her stomach. The merrow twists the weapon, then rips it free; the mermaid shudders once then goes still.</p>

                        <p>Scattered about the throne room are more guards, as well as other members of the royal court. A young merman swims forward and calls out in a loud voice:</p>

He begs the heroes to bring an end to the war by assaulting the Merrow Fortress (L6) and killing the warlord, Sheksis. He warns the party that she is in league with a coven of hags.</p>
                    <p>If the heroes agree, the king assigns a war party of nereid to accompany them. There is one nereid per hero. Both the heroes and the nereid are given giant sea horses as mounts. The assault on the merrow fortress is something that should be quite easy for the heroes.</p>

            <p>Thousands of years ago, an angel was cast out from the heavens for believing that the secrets of divinity should be given to the mortal races. His name was Phaeros (CN solar). Before he was exiled, he managed to steal the Promethean Fire. He wandered the planes for centuries before coming to the lands of Thylea. During his travels, he despised the tyranny of Sydon and Lutheria, and he decided that he would use the Promethean Fire to change the world of Thylea for the better.</p>
            <p>Phaeros sought out the greatest champion of each race and brought them to the City of the Sirens, the most beautiful city in Thylea. The sirens welcomed Phaeros, for they had fallen out of favor with the Titans and saw the angel as a messianic savior. Phaeros elevated each champion to godhood, creating a new pantheon. The sirens built great temples to each of the gods and sent missionaries out into the rest of Thylea to bring news of this new faith to the other races.</p>
            <p>But the Twin Titans saw this and called upon their father, Kentimane, to stop Phaeros. Sydon and Lutheria saw Phaeros as a foreign invader who intended to subvert everything that they had created. Kentimane released the great beast, Scylla, from its imprisonment on Typhon. Then Scylla and the Titans waged war against the new gods. This battle raged on for weeks, but finally, Phaeros was devoured by Scylla.</p>
            <p>In the aftermath of the battle, Lutheria convinced the remaining gods to return to their temples, where she would offer them redemption—a chance to atone for the sins of Phaeros. This was a trick—Lutheria used her magic to trap the gods in their temples. Kentimane then rose out of the ocean and destroyed the foundations of the city, so that the oceans swallowed it.</p>
            <p>Each of the new gods has remained trapped at the bottom of the ocean for thousands of years. They know that if they could convince someone to kill Scylla and rescue Phaeros, they could return to the surface world and rule over it again as gods.</p>

Each of the gods is either a young empyrean or elder empyrean. While the gods can be destroyed, they will simply reform in their temple in 1d6 days.</p>
                <p>Over the millennia, the gods have convinced several intelligent marine creatures to worship them, including the merfolk and nereid that live in the ruins of the Sunken Kingdom. The gods want these worshippers to free them from imprisonment by killing Scylla, but so far none have been up to the task. These faithful creatures are protective and jealous of their chosen god.</p>

                    <p>If approached, the gods are all willing to speak with the heroes. They explain that after being trapped for so many millennia, they wish to leave the world of Thylea and explore the many worlds that lie beyond. They want to leave Thylea in capable hands, and they feel that the heroes are the best candidates for that responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Each of the gods will single out one of the heroes and flatter them, extolling their virtues. Each god selects one hero as a "worthy successor,"and grant them gifts.</p>

                    <p>The gods tell the heroes that they must destroy Scylla, for she has swallowed the Promethean Fire. With the fire released, the gods will be free, and they can use the power of the Promethean Fire to grant a spark of divinity to each of the heroes.</p>

                    <p>The empyreans are lying to the heroes—they are entirely self-interested. They have had their minds twisted by millennia of imprisonment.

The giants are badly scarred from a failed attempt to kill Scylla. Half of their kin were killed when they descended to the bottom of the Chasm and tried to kill the beast.</p>

                    <p>The goddess meditates at the top of her 300 ft. tall tower, surrounded by a bright nimbus of light. Anyone approaching within 30 ft. of the Sun Goddess is &Reference[condition=blinded] until they move away. The area 20 ft. from the Sun Goddess is considered difficult terrain. Anyone that moves through this light takes 35 (10d6) radiant damage per 5 ft. moved. When someone touches the Sun Goddess, her nimbus of light dims, and she identifies the person who touched her as her chosen messiah.</p>

                <p>The Chasm is a massive fissure at the center of the Sunken City. It stretches down for miles into an abyss that eventually connects to the Nether Sea. The waters of the Nether Sea are steeped in primordial magic and have twisted the sea life here into creatures of immense size and power. The most powerful and dangerous of these creatures is Scylla. Scylla is an abomination. She is the most dangerous creature ever spawned from the island of Typhon. The Titans released her millennia ago, to help defeat the angel Phaeros and his rogue pantheon of gods. Now Phaeros is trapped in her stomach. She sleeps at the bottom of the Chasm, served by an army of merrow who occasionally feed her sacrificial offerings.</p>
                <p>The Chasm has three zones. Each of these zones has a different environment than the other zones and is populated by its own unique set of creatures.</p>

                    <p>Light still barely permeates the Upper Reaches of the Chasm, which extends down for the first 1,000 feet. This entire region is considered dim light. Standard aquatic life can be found here, including a wide variety of fish, octopus, and squid. These creatures have learned to avoid the huge predators that hunt in the region. Giant sharks are the apex predator of the Upper Reaches. The sharks are descended from the even more massive cetus that swim in the lower regions of the Chasm.</p>

                    <p>Darkness is complete within the Void. The entire region is considered dark, though darkvision still works. Eels and squid are found in the inky depths, along with strange fish that can generate light (such as anglerfish and viperfish). This region is extremely dangerous, for massive sea serpents and primordial cetus hunt in the waters. The cursed ichthys crawl along the sides of the chasm and have even banded together into a small and hateful tribe. The only creature that wouldn't immediately consider humanoid trespassers to be food is a single dragon turtle that lairs in a cave.</p>

                    <p>The very bottom of the Chasm is pitch black. However, swirls of silvery water occasionally light up small regions of the Pit. These are currents that have come from the Nether Sea. The bottom of the Chasm is littered with the decayed corpses of prey killed in the regions above. Whale corpses are the most common, but there are also dead ichthys, merfolk, and other intelligent sea dwellers. The corpses provide food for the only living creature in the Pit—the abomination known as Scylla.</p>
