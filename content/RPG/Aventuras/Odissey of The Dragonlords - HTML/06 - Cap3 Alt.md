<h1 id="chapter-3-summoned-by-the-king">Chapter 3: Summoned by the King</h1>
<p>“_You may be a goddess, my queen, but you fail to understand the hearts of your subjects. I alone know what is best for my people. Do not question me._”</p>
<p>— King Acastus, to Queen Vallus, the Goddess of Wisdom</p>
<p>King Acastus has learned that the Heroes of the Prophecy have completed the first of their Great Labors. He has dispatched seven of his most loyal centurions to find the heroes and bring them before his throne, and the people of the great city of Mytros eagerly await the arrival of the famed heroes. Tales of their great exploits already circulate in every tavern: it is even rumored that they travel in the company of the gods!</p>
<h4 id="when-should-i-start-this-chapter">When Should I Start This Chapter?</h4>
<p>p86</p>
<p>This chapter introduces major characters and includes critical story developments. Run this part of the adventure after the heroes have completed two or three of their Great Labors. The king&#39;s centurions might intercept the heroes on the roads of the Heartlands or in the city of Estoria.</p>
<p>p86</p>
<p>In the distant skies, you can make out three winged forms approaching you. The sun shimmers off their scales, and you realize that they are young copper dragons. You have heard rumors of the dragons of Mytros, but these creatures are far more splendid than you imagined. The dragons are ridden by red-cloaked knights: high ranking centurions from the city. The dragons descend and touch down several dozen yards away. Three knights with shields and swords dismount and approach you. The determined look in their eyes suggests that they have been sent here with a mission, but they clearly mean you no harm. Their leader steps forward and introduces himself, &quot;I am Tarchon. We have come on behalf of King Acastus to escort you to his palace. He wishes an audience with you.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Tarchon</strong> (NG @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain}) is accompanied by two other captains. They are mounted on @UUID[Actor.QBpQf4GZ4nwwWBe1]{young copper dragons}. He explains that the Lord of Storms has waylaid the city of Mytros with a devastating hurricane. King Acastus expects the heroes to come to the city&#39;s aid at once.</p>
<p>Tarchon and his men have been ordered not to return without the heroes. However, they won&#39;t attack the party, even if provoked. If the heroes refuse to come with him, Tarchon will appeal to the party&#39;s sense of honor and duty. He also confesses that Acastus is not a forgiving king; if the knights return empty-handed, he will be punished.</p>
<p>Tarchon is one of a burgeoning order of dragon-mounted soldiers commanded by the king. They call themselves Dragonlords, after the king&#39;s ancestors. Kyrah and the other gods are dismissive of this new order, calling it an exercise in pure vanity.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="traveling-to-mytros">Traveling to Mytros</h1>
<p>Traveling to Mytros takes about one day from most of the outer reaches of the Heartlands. You may choose to run one @UUID[RollTable.N6Iw2MNaGWIfoEYY]{random land encounter} during this time. If Tarchon and his men are present, they will leave all the dangerous work to the heroes. They have no wish to risk harm to their dragons.</p>
<h2 id="the-royal-gate">The Royal Gate</h2>
<p>This massive gate can be accessed from the paved road that snakes up the hillside. The road is wide enough to accommodate traffic moving in both directions. The towers that flank the gate are carved to represent the writhing forms of dozens of dragons.</p>
<p>p87</p>
<p>As you approach the city of Mytros, you are reminded of its immense scale. Its walls and temples sprawl across the foundations of Mount Volkan, and its great harbor stretches for miles across the coast. This is the jewel of Thylea: the bastion of mortal civilization.</p>
<p>But something is wrong. Massive, swirling black clouds loom over the city, the wind battering its ships and tearing at its banners. Howling gales greet you as your draw closer to the city gates, and it becomes difficult just to put one foot in front of another. The centurions at the Royal Gate urgently beckon you into the city as torrential rain hammers down.</p>
<p>Glancing up into the sky, you notice that something ominous has materialized within the spinning eye of the hurricane. It&#39;s the scowling visage of Sydon, Lord of Storms. His angry eyes rove the city, until they abruptly lock onto your exact position. The titan conjures a crackling white bolt of lightning and hurls it at you.</p>
<p>Have the heroes roll for initiative. Whoever rolls the lowest is immediately struck by the bolt of lightning, which hits with the same effects as a @UUID[Item.TeRzT0AMTpPY2LkS]{lightning bolt} spell. The chosen hero still gets a saving throw versus the spell. You may choose to have Sydon throw a second bolt at the hero with the second lowest initiative. After the lightning strikes, the storm continues, but Sydon&#39;s face can no longer be seen in the clouds.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-palace">The Great Palace</h2>
<p>Now that the heroes are in the city, Tarchon escorts them straight to the Great Palace, preventing them from stopping along the way. He explains that once the king&#39;s dilemma has been resolved, the party will be free to wander and explore the palace and city.</p>
<h4 id="the-ceaseless-storms">The Ceaseless Storms</h4>
<p>p87</p>
<p>At this point, you may choose to allow the heroes to explore the City of Mytros, but the storms make it difficult to do much of anything beyond visit local landmarks. Most people are locked down inside to wait out the storm, and the Great Games cannot begin until the storms end. Tarchon and his centurions will urge the heroes to come to the Great Palace as soon as possible.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-throne-room">The Throne Room</h1>
<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#acastus,-king-of-mytros]{King Acastus} (see appendix) can be found here during the day. The king is always protected by seven of his best centurions (LG @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains}). He is usually accompanied by his concubine <strong>Bella</strong> (CN @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}). He frequently calls upon the services of @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#commander-gaius]{Commander Gaius} (see appendix), who represents the Order of Sydon within the city.</p>
<p>p87</p>
<p>Centurions escort you through marble colonnades of the palace and into the Royal Hall, where the king waits. Rain hammers loudly upon the palace roof and, as you enter the throne room, an ear-splitting crack of thunder rolls across the sky.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man with a powerful build sits on a gilded throne opposite the entrance. On the step below him are four others: a beautiful ageless woman of regal bearing, a soldier dressed in a cerulean cloak, a tiefling wearing a black robe, and a finely-dressed young woman. Centurions stand at attention along the walls of the room.</p>
<p>p87</p>
<p>“_Acastus is certainly cunning, but it will avail us little against the power of the Titans. This is not an age that demands crafty politicians or charismatic kings. We need heroes and great warriors: no more, no less._”</p>
<p>— Aesop, Keeper of the Dragon Shrine</p>
<h2 id="the-kings-dilemma">The King&#39;s Dilemma</h2>
<p>p88</p>
<p>The king beams on seeing you. &quot;Here they are—the Heroes of the Heartlands. Welcome, honored guests! You have come not a moment too soon. I am in desperate need of your counsel. As you may have noticed, our beautiful city is besieged by evil weather. We have wasted several days discussing how best to placate the Lord of Storms, but my advisors cannot seem to agree upon <em>anything</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Oracle&#39;s prophecy has angered Sydon. That much is clear. You are the ones who were foretold to confront the Titans and restore balance to Thylea. Therefore, I have decided that you must be the ones to decide how we resolve this crisis.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>King Acastus</strong> and @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#vallus,-goddess-of-wisdom]{Queen Vallus} (see appendix) are accompanied by <strong>Gaius</strong> and <strong>Bella</strong>. The tiefling calls himself @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#chondrus]{Chondrus} (see appendix). He is an emissary from the Cult of Lutheria and the king dislikes him. He cannot be ignored, however, because he represents powerful interests within the city.</p>
<h4 id="the-origin-of-the-dragon-eggs">The Origin of the Dragon Eggs</h4>
<p>p88</p>
<p>If Acastus is ever asked about where he found the dragon eggs that have allowed him to revive the Dragonlords, he will lie. He says that he sent heroes to explore Thylea a decade ago in an attempt to find dragon eggs. His plan has finally come to fruition, for his heroes discovered a cache of dragon eggs and the lair of an adult silver named Icarus. Acastus claims that Icarus has befriended him, and the dragon wishes to help him rebuild the order.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords/Chapter3_KingAcastus_Page88.webp" alt="King Acastus" title="King Acastus"></p>
<p>King Acastus</p>
<h2 id="four-possible-solutions">Four Possible Solutions</h2>
<p>Secretly, Acastus knows that every possible course of action will be considered controversial by the people of Mytros, and he does not want to be held responsible for any consequences. He wants the heroes to make the decision, so that they will be blamed rather than him. In summary, here are the options that the heroes must choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cast the 8th level spell @UUID[Item.ouELOSxkyCDRMHrw]{control weather}.</li>
<li>Order the destruction of the Temple of the Five.</li>
<li>Purchase 10,000 gp worth of livestock to sacrifice.</li>
<li>Convince the gods to work a miracle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever solution the heroes choose, the king will order it done immediately. If the chosen action is successful, Sydon will be appeased or his magic will be countered. In either case, the storms will pass.</p>
<h3 id="option-1-king-acastus">Option 1: King Acastus</h3>
<p>First, the king wonders whether the heroes can <strong>stop the storm with magic.</strong> He has heard that there are powerful spells that may be used to alter the weather. Surely if the rumors about the heroes are true, then they should be mighty enough to command such magic?</p>
<h4 id="controlling-the-weather">Controlling the Weather</h4>
<p>p88</p>
<p>Acastus refers to the 8th level spell @UUID[Item.ouELOSxkyCDRMHrw]{control weather}, which the heroes probably cannot cast. However, if the party has collected two sets of nymph-hair strings, then they can craft the Boreal harp at the Mithral Forge. In this case, a bard will be capable of casting the spell, but Acastus is impatient, so the harp must have been created before they answer the summons to Mytros.</p>
<p>When it becomes clear that the heroes cannot use magic, the king feigns disappointment. If the heroes chose not to sacrifice the great boar to Sydon earlier in the story, Acastus may also wonder aloud at their wisdom in making such a decision.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords/Chapter3_ThroneRoom_Page89.webp" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="option-2-commander-gaius">Option 2: Commander Gaius</h3>
<p>Gaius angrily demands that the king <strong>dismantle the Temple of the Five</strong> and smash every stone to dust. Sydon abhors the worship of other gods, and especially worship of the Five. Gaius has argued for decades that the Temple of the Five should be destroyed, but the idea has recently gained some popular support. If Gaius is to be believed, smashing the temple is the only way to appease the Lord of Storms.</p>
<p>Gaius is also contemptuous of both the heroes and Queen Vallus. She is, after all, one of the Five Gods and the daughter of the patron god of the city. As the commander of the Order of Sydon, Gaius believes that the city must abandon its worship of the Five, and stop putting any faith in these &quot;puppets of the Oracle.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="destroying-the-temple">Destroying the Temple</h4>
<p>p89</p>
<p>If the heroes choose to order the destruction of the Temple of the Five, then the gods will grudgingly accept this course of action. Vallus and Kyrah have long believed that it was inevitable that their power would wane and that the people of Mytros would lose faith, but they had hoped that it would not happen in such a fashion. However, this loss of worship still causes pain to the Five. As a result of the temple&#39;s destruction, Kyrah, Vallus, Pythor, and Volkan will become dispirited and suffer one level of permanent &amp;Reference[condition=exhaustion].</p>
<h3 id="option-3-chondrus">Option 3: Chondrus</h3>
<p>Chondrus argues that Sydon can only be placated by the intervention of Lutheria, his sister-wife. To gain her help the king should <strong>order seventy children of the city to &quot;take the black robes&quot;</strong> and dedicate themselves to the Cult of Lutheria. He promises that the Lady of Dreams will treat the children well—they will eat the finest of foods and drink the sweetest of wines.</p>
<p>In fact, they will all be sacrificed in the cult&#39;s perverse blood rituals. Everyone suspects this and hates the suggestion. Queen Vallus would have Chondrus killed before she would allow it to happen.</p>
<h4 id="keeper-of-the-great-library">Keeper of the Great Library</h4>
<p>p89</p>
<p>Chondrus appears later in the adventure on the Island of Yonder. He hopes to convince the heroes to bargain with Lutheria. If the heroes manage to turn the king against him, he will use @UUID[Item.5a0yO6vF5jvNCHz9]{dimension door} to escape back to his lair.</p>
<h3 id="option-4-bella-the-concubine">Option 4: Bella the Concubine</h3>
<p>In normal circumstances, Bella should have no voice in this matter, but the king indulges her. She innocently asks why the usual solution has not been tried. Normally, the priests of Sydon sacrifice dozens of animals to placate the storm god. Acastus explains that for a storm like this one, they would need to <strong>perform a hecatomb, a sacrifice of 100 oxen.</strong> This would require half the livestock in the city, and it would cost about 10,000 gp. Perhaps the heroes might pay the cost? The royal coffers cannot afford such an expense...</p>
<h3 id="option-5-queen-vallus">Option 5: Queen Vallus</h3>
<p>p90</p>
<p>Queen Vallus suddenly stands up from her throne and approaches you directly, ignoring the protests of the king. She radiates a sense of profound intellect and divine beauty.</p>
<p>&quot;Heroes of the Prophecy, I greet you. I am Vallus, of the Five Gods. For centuries, the people of Mytros have revered me as the goddess of wisdom. Mortal kings once traveled from across the Cerulean Gulf seeking my counsel but, as you can see, my husband prefers to consult with fools and concubines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We gods are capable of saving the city. Joined together, the four of us can weave a spell to counter Sydon&#39;s magic. Such a miracle will require a sacrifice of our power. I will do what must be done to protect my city, but the others will need to be persuaded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have summoned Kyrah, Pythor, and Volkan to the palace so that you might speak with them and make them see reason. You are the Oracle&#39;s chosen. They will heed your words.&quot;</p>
<p>Vallus wants the heroes to <strong>convince Pythor, Kyrah, and Volkan to help her work a miracle.</strong> This depends on the heroes&#39; ability to convince the other three gods to surrender a portion of their power to protect the city from Sydon&#39;s magic. Working the miracle will cause the gods to suffer <strong>one level of permanent</strong> &amp;Reference[condition=exhaustion], but it will bolster the city&#39;s faith in the Five Gods.</p>
<h4 id="performing-a-miracle">Performing a Miracle</h4>
<p>p90</p>
<p>If the heroes choose this course of action, then Vallus calls Kyrah, Pythor, and Volkan into the throne room. The heroes must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Alternatively, you can simply roleplay this encounter by having each hero make a separate plea to the gods.</p>
<p>If the gods are convinced, then they will vow to protect the city. They thank the heroes for their wisdom and go to the Temple of the Five to seek the guidance of Mytros.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords/Chapter3_QueenVallus_Page90.webp" alt="Queen Vallus" title="Queen Vallus"></p>
<p>Queen Vallus</p>
<p>“_For centuries, I ruled this city alone. With the looming war, I sought to share my burden with Acastus. Even the gods may have regrets._”</p>
<p>— Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-storms-vanish">The Storms Vanish</h1>
<p>p90</p>
<p>Hours pass, and the storm gradually relents. Light breaks through the breaking clouds, spilling down onto the marble pediments and wet paving stones of the city. Slowly, citizens begin to emerge from their homes. Before long, the usual bustle of everyday life in Mytros resumes.</p>
<p>King Acastus looks pleased. &quot;Excellent work! I knew I could trust you to handle this matter. Now, let&#39;s see about your reward...&quot;He pulls a rolled parchment out of his cloak and hands it to you.</p>
<p>&quot;This map will lead you to the last known whereabouts of the <em>Ultros.</em> It was my ancestor&#39;s ship, the legendary vessel of Estor Arkelander, fiercest of the Dragonlords. There was a time when I thought I might claim it for myself, but I have no need of it now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should know that I am rebuilding the ancient order of the Dragonlords. In time, I will have a legion of dragon-mounted warriors under my command. Then we will have no more need of heroes and Oracles. We shall drive back the Titans with the power of the dragons, just as my forefathers did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In any case, this map will allow you to resume your so-called &#39;Great Labors.&#39; I thank you for the service you have done my city. You are dismissed.&quot;</p>
<p>The king rewards the heroes with the map to the <em>Ultros</em>, which was last seen near the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#the-dead-falls]{Dead Falls}.</p>
<p>Acastus encourages the heroes to leave his city as soon as possible, because their fame has begun to overshadow his own. Secretly, he will pray to Sydon that his bloodthirsty undead ancestor will kill the heroes and put an end to their glory-hogging ways.</p>
<p>If the heroes ask why they must recover the <em>Ultros</em> instead of sailing some other ship, Acastus explains, truthfully, that the wrath of Sydon makes travel beyond the coast nearly impossible. They will need a legendary ship if they are to survive the journey.</p>
<h4 id="the-kings-motives">The King&#39;s Motives</h4>
<p>p91</p>
<p>As a descendant of the Dragonlords, Acastus feels as though he will never live up to the legends of his ancestors. The ghost of Estor Arkelander taunts the king in his dreams, promising him fame, glory, and immortality. However, the king knows that his ancestor has treacherous designs. Estor seeks to possess a living host so that he may wreak vengeance upon the Titans. Acastus is sending the heroes to the <em>Ultros,</em> hoping to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="summoned-by-the-queen">Summoned by the Queen</h1>
<p>Before the heroes leave the Great Palace, Queen Vallus sends her chief stewardess, Makhaira, to intercept them as they are leaving the throne room. Makhaira escorts the heroes to see the queen in her chambers.</p>
<h2 id="the-queens-chambers">The Queen&#39;s Chambers</h2>
<p>When the heroes arrive, Queen Vallus is resting on a divan across from a series of gilded mirrors. She is accompanied by many scribes and servants in white. While Acastus is off playing king, Vallus works hard behind closed doors, performing the many necessary duties of a true head of state.</p>
<h4 id="the-queens-warriors">The Queen&#39;s Warriors</h4>
<p>p91</p>
<p>The queen&#39;s chief stewardess is <strong>Makhaila</strong> (LG @UUID[Actor.lpFwFXc1dnWn5E8n]{Amazon Warrior}), who commands twelve @UUID[Actor.lpFwFXc1dnWn5E8n]{amazon warriors}. Makhaira was exiled from Themis by Queen Thesilea VI and came to Mytros ten years ago. She is fiercely loyal to Queen Vallus.</p>
<h2 id="the-queens-warning">The Queen&#39;s Warning</h2>
<p>Vallus explains that her husband has not been entirely honest with the party. The map to the <em>Ultros</em> is accurate, but the king is almost certainly sending the heroes to their doom. She knows that Acastus has been troubled in his sleep by dreams of some kind, and she thinks that his unusual generosity is somehow connected to this. He would never give the heroes such a gift unless he believed that it would work to his advantage.</p>
<p>Vallus insists that when the heroes have acquired the Ultros, they should return to her immediately. She is certain that her &#39;stupid husband&#39; will try to take the ship. She feels that nothing good can come of Acastus controlling both the ship and the dragons.</p>
<h3 id="conflicts-in-the-city">Conflicts in the City</h3>
<p>Vallus also explains that there are deep conflicts within the city between the followers of the Five and the followers of the Titans. She has some suspicions about what the Titans want. You can decide if your players need to hear anything of the history of the Titans at this point, or whether this would only muddy the waters for them. She is desperately worried that, at the time when the Oath of Peace ends, the powers of the Five Gods will be fully spent. If Pythor or Kyrah are present, she will also be concerned for them, and will make a point of asking after the health of Volkan, her father.</p>
<h3 id="quest-the-cult-of-lutheria">Quest: The Cult of Lutheria</h3>
<p>This quest is optional, depending upon whether or not you want the party to explore Mytros before they set out on their quest to recover the <em>Ultros</em>.</p>
<p>Vallus asks the heroes for a favor. Sydon may have been pacified this time, but the Titans should pay a price for their cruelty and impudence. While attacking the Temple of Sydon would be too much of a provocation, the Cult of Lutheria is gaining a dangerous amount of influence in the city. Vallus asks the heroes to help the city by striking a blow against the cult.</p>
<p>The queen suggests that the heroes should investigate the <em>Temple of Lutheria</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m20.-temple-of-lutheria]{M20}) in <em>Stygian Row</em>. This is not an invitation to cause chaos in the lower city—the heroes should approach this carefully and collect evidence against them if possible. The Cult is popular because it supplies the city with much of its wine.</p>
<h3 id="one-final-warning">One Final Warning</h3>
<p>Before the heroes leave, Vallus repeats her warning about Acastus: the king does not need to know when the party has recovered the <em>Ultros</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-blessing-of-vallus">The Blessing of Vallus</h4>
<p>p91</p>
<p>If the heroes sacrificed the great boar to Vallus, she will reluctantly thank them but she doesn&#39;t understands why they did so. Most such offerings are made to her mother, Mytros. She is appreciative, however, and she grants the heroes her blessing before they leave.</p>
<h2 id="encounter-the-kings-dragon">Encounter: The King&#39;s Dragon</h2>
<p>The king&#39;s dragon, <strong>Icarus</strong> (CN @UUID[Actor.y9UK5qus1DpoDecI]{Adult Silver Dragon}), is loudly snoring in the main courtyard of the <em>Great Palace,</em> lying atop a small fortune&#39;s worth of silver coins. The king happily allows him to sleep here. The dragon is attended by seven servants, who have been ordered to pamper him with new trinkets and freshly-slaughtered sheep each day.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords/Chapter3_IcarusTheKingsDragon_Page92.webp" alt="Icarus, the King&#39;s Dragon" title="Icarus, the King&#39;s Dragon"></p>
<p>Icarus, the King&#39;s Dragon</p>
<h4 id="icarus-the-adolescent">Icarus the Adolescent</h4>
<p>p92</p>
<p>Although Icarus has the body of an adult dragon, he has the callow mind of a twenty year-old wyrmling. Gaius&#39;s silver dragon, Argyn, is the same. Twenty years ago, when Acastus became King of Mytros, Lutheria gave him several @UUID[Item.YD6FaLDVbUfHa35k]{dragon eggs}, along with @UUID[Item.IBy2D5CgWxHeMpZ2]{potions of aging} to feed the dragons in order to accelerate their growth. Both Icarus and Argyn were hatched and raised in this way.</p>
<p>The heroes may talk to the dragon if they wish, but it will quickly become evident that he&#39;s spoiled rotten and completely self-absorbed. Icarus knows little of what is happening in Thylea, and he cares even less.</p>
<h3 id="treasure">Treasure</h3>
<p>The dragon&#39;s treasure pile contains 20,000 sp. He will awaken immediately if even a single coin is touched, but his first instinct is not to be angry. He likes it when people admire his treasure, and he will allow each hero to take as much as 25 sp, because he likes to feel generous and lordly. However, if the heroes attempt to take more than the few coins he allows them, he will grow annoyed and call for guards to escort them away.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="exploring-the-city">Exploring the City</h1>
<p>Now that the heroes have solved the king&#39;s dilemma and learned of the whereabouts of the Ultros, they are free to explore Mytros. They can attempt to recover the Ultros, participate in the Great Games, or investigate other strange events in the city.</p>
<p>As the heroes exit the palace, they begin to realize that their fame precedes them.</p>
<h4 id="encounter-your-adoring-fans">Encounter: Your Adoring Fans</h4>
<p>p92</p>
<p>As you leave the palace, you realize that people everywhere are watching you with great interest. You hear excited chatter among the crowds. &quot;It&#39;s the Oracle&#39;s chosen ones, the heroes of the Heartlands! They&#39;ve come to Mytros to save us from the Titans!&quot;</p>
<p>Several merchants approach you, expressing gratitude for the work you&#39;ve done to make the roads safer to travel. Detachments of centurions salute as you walk past. As news of your presence spreads, more and more admirers crowd around you, vying for your attention. Before long, your progress through the city streets has slowed to a crawl.</p>
<h2 id="continuing-the-story">Continuing the Story</h2>
<p>Now that the heroes have a map to the Ultros, they may choose to attempt the next Great Labor. In this case, run @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#the-ghost-ship-ultros]{The Ghost Ship Ultros} adventure.</p>
<p>Or the heroes may choose to investigate strange happenings in the city, in which case, they should ask around for rumors about the Cult of the Snake. This will lead to the adventures in @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#the-colossus-of-pythor]{The Colossus of Pythor} section.</p>
<p>With the storms gone, you might decide that it&#39;s time for a celebration in the city. Refer to @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#the-great-games]{The Great Games} section to give the party a break from dungeon crawling.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-city-of-mytros">The City of Mytros</h1>
<p>The City of Mytros Founded five centuries ago, Mytros is named after the matriarch of the Five Gods—the Goddess of Dawn, who is also called the &#39;Silver Queen.&#39; She is the patron goddess of the city, although her influence has waned somewhat in recent centuries.</p>
<p>The city was built around a natural harbor, where trade ships arrive with goods from the distant city of Aresia. Two great bronze colossi once guarded the harbor, but only one of them is still standing. The city&#39;s silhouette is dominated by several massive temples.</p>
<p>The hills above the harbor provide views that reach as far as the Mithral Mountains and the Oldwoods. These two hills are where the most important buildings are located. One hill is the religious and political center of the city, while the other hill is its mercantile center. Between the hills are slums known as Stygian Row. Behind the city is Mount Volkan, an extinct volcano named after the husband of Mytros.</p>
<p>Mytros is mostly a beautiful and clean city. The streets are cleaned every night, and the citizens frown upon those who allow their mounts to defecate in the streets. The city houses close to 50,000 people and, although the majority of the population are human, Mytros is the most diverse city in Thylea, with every race represented.</p>
<p>Many of the greatest structures in the city are built entirely from marble, inlaid with bronze, adorned with painted tiles and beautiful mosaics. During the day, the heat of the sun can make the city seem like a mirage, as the air shimmers and the buildings glitter from the reflected sunlight. Great walls surround and protect the city, with only two major entry points—the <em>Royal Gate</em> and the <em>Commerce Gate</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="factions-in-mytros">Factions in Mytros</h1>
<p>Mytros is not a united city. A number of factions compete for influence over the citizenry.</p>
<h2 id="queen-vallus">Queen Vallus</h2>
<p>Vallus has been the queen of Mytros for centuries, but she is far removed from her people. As the goddess of wisdom, she is viewed as the natural successor to Mytros, her mother, and her right to rule is affirmed by the Temple of the Five. However, as the Oath of Peace fails, faith in the Five Gods has waned, and people are growing restless with anxiety about the Titans.</p>
<h2 id="king-acastus">King Acastus</h2>
<p>Acastus has been the king of Mytros ever since he persuaded Vallus to marry him, some twenty years ago. He is extremely popular in the city, especially since he obtained a huge silver dragon. The blood of Estor Arkelander flows in his veins, and many view him as the successor of the ancient Dragonlords. Most believe him to be a strong and wise ruler, or else why would Vallus have married him?</p>
<h2 id="the-order-of-sydon">The Order of Sydon</h2>
<p>The Order of Sydon are devout worshippers of the Lord of Storms. Although the Titan sent hurricanes to punish the city for its faith in the Five Gods, a surprising number of people worship him and support the Order. Commander Gaius is often seen flying over the city on his silver dragon, and he&#39;s a popular figure with young men and women who dream of joining the Order.</p>
<h2 id="the-cult-of-the-snake">The Cult of the Snake</h2>
<p>The Cult of the Snake are known for their abiding loyalty to a mysterious figure called the Lady of Coins. Those who displease the Lady are often found turned to stone, with a green snake painted on a nearby wall. The Cult of the Snake is actually a thieves&#39; guild, and hence its influence is covert rather than open. Most of the thieves in the city are loyal to the Lady.</p>
<h2 id="the-cult-of-lutheria">The Cult of Lutheria</h2>
<p>The Cult of Lutheria is the oldest cult in Mytros. The cultists are unabashed worshippers of the Lady of Dreams. Most people find their beliefs and rituals to be repugnant, but they are tolerated because they provide wine and entertainment for the popular wine festivals. In truth, they would have been ejected from the city a long time ago, except that they have &quot;friends in high places&quot;—devotees among the aristocracy.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="events-in-mytros">Events in Mytros</h1>
<p>These are events that can occur in Mytros while the heroes are exploring the city.</p>
<h2 id="event-the-great-games">Event: The Great Games</h2>
<p>p93</p>
<p>You hear the sound of a runner&#39;s footsteps coming from behind you. Before you can react, the source of the noise dashes past you: a lithe young man carrying a torch. He runs for another block before handing the flame to another runner, who immediately takes off in the same direction. The first runner&#39;s friends gather around him and congratulate him. Laughter and excited shouting fill the air.</p>
<p>&quot;The Great Games are beginning!&quot;</p>
<p>The Great Games begin when the pyre is lit beneath the ruins of the <em>Colossus of Mytros</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m15.-the-ruined-colossus]{M15}). Some people in the street notice the heroes looking at the torch bearer. They cheerfully explain that anyone, even great heroes, can enter the Games. If the heroes wish to enter, then refer to @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#the-great-games]{The Great Games} section.</p>
<h2 id="event-the-funeral-sacrifice">Event: The Funeral Sacrifice</h2>
<p>p93</p>
<p>You stumble upon a melancholy scene. Dozens of figures dressed in black robes march somberly down the street in an orderly procession. Mourners line the street: wailing spouses, dumbstruck children, and resigned elders look on. A large bronze cage is held aloft towards the front of the procession. Inside the cage is a shackled minotaur.</p>
<p>This is a funeral procession for a dozen centurions killed fighting the centaur tribes on the borders of civilization. The women wail in an ostentatious display of grief for the dead while children look on dumbstruck and slightly scared by the caged beast.</p>
<p>The caged @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{Minotaur} is for a ritual battle before the funeral. Most citizens of Mytros consider minotaurs to be murderous brutes, fit only for use in games and rituals. They are sometimes captured by slavers and forced into oaths of servitude.</p>
<p>Once they&#39;ve been exhausted by years of forced labor, they are entered into gladiatorial games, where most of them are eventually slaughtered. Refer to the <em>Minotaur Market</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m21.-the-minotaur-market]{M21}) for details about this dark stain on the culture of the city.</p>
<p>The procession stops just outside of the <em>Royal Gate</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m6.-the-royal-gate]{M6}), where a group of pyres has been lit for the dead soldiers. Nearby, a walled pen has been constructed for the funerary games. A group of three @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{soldiers}, family members of the deceased, will be chosen to fight the minotaur. A @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{Priest} of Sydon announces that the sacrifice of the minotaur is a blessing for the dead.</p>
<p>Ritual Combat.</p>
<p>The soldiers fight the unarmed minotaur to the death. As long as the heroes do not interfere, one of the soldiers will be badly injured but the minotaur will be defeated and killed. Intervening on the side of the minotaur will earn the heroes sour looks and suspicious gossip among the superstitious citizenry.</p>
<h3 id="optional-event-bullbug">Optional Event: Bullbug</h3>
<p>You can replace the minotaur with @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#bullbug]{Bullbug} (NG @UUID[Actor.P1kQCEodGIdtHop1]{Minotaur Hero}). Bullbug easily defeats the soldiers, but he refuses to kill them. Now freed, he calls out a friendly challenge to the heroes. If one of the heroes can beat Bullbug, he will offer to join their crew.</p>
<h2 id="event-statues-of-terror">Event: Statues of Terror</h2>
<p>p94</p>
<p>A small group of people gathers on the road nearby. The object of their interest is easily spotted. It is an incredibly lifelike statue of a woman that has suddenly appeared in the middle of the city street. The statue has a look of abject terror on its face.</p>
<p>The gathered citizens will agree that the statue is remarkably lifelike, but none of them recall having seen it before. Centurions arrive within minutes and ask everyone to clear away. The centurions explain that this looks like the work of the Lady of Coins, as though the heroes should know exactly what that means.</p>
<p>If the heroes express interest, the centurions tell the heroes to speak with the powerful merchant, Lord Taran. He has publicly called for the Lady of Coins to be brought to justice. The centurions are mildly surprised that he is still alive. Lord Taran can be found at his villa on the <em>Neurdagon Estate</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m11.-the-neurdagon-estate]{M11}).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="random-encounters">Random Encounters</h1>
<p>These encounters are an easy way to add color to the city. Roll on the following chart whenever you want something unusual to happen in the city.</p>
<p>Random Encounters in Mytros</p>
<p>[[/r d20]]</p>
<p>Encounter</p>
<p>1-2</p>
<p>A lost-looking warrior monk from Aresia asks you for directions to the Colosseum. He intends to participate in the Great Games.</p>
<p>3-4</p>
<p>Two young @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{acolytes} in gray togas ask you for a donation to the Temple of the Five. A passing @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain} from the Order of Sydon shoves them to the ground and spits on them.</p>
<p>5-6</p>
<p>Several young children carrying wooden pikes and shields scurry up to you. &quot;Are you Dragonlords? You don&#39;t look so tough to me!&quot;</p>
<p>7-8</p>
<p>A band of @UUID[Actor.gYGismFvuOX2rEUe]{satyrs} playing harps and flutes begin to sing songs about you as you pass. The songs at first seem flattering, but you start to think they&#39;re making fun of you.</p>
<p>9-10</p>
<p>Seven @UUID[Actor.DeD0njf9CfukCiBL]{cultists} are roasting spitted pigs over a bronze bier. They offer free pork and wine to passersby. &quot;Compliments of the Temple of Lutheria. All hail the Lady of Dreams!&quot;</p>
<p>11-12</p>
<p>Suddenly, a copper coin smacks you in the forehead. You hear a bleating laugh from the rooftops. A single @UUID[Actor.XCfvQueH2aXzTSRG]{Goatling} grins down at you. &quot;Keep the change, little starveling!&quot;</p>
<p>13-14</p>
<p>Dozens of hoplites in bronze armor march past you. They seem to be heading for the city gates, perhaps to reinforce the outlying settlements. &quot;For the glory of Mytros!&quot;</p>
<p>15-16</p>
<p>A portly herald in a white toga stands on a pedestal. He speaks in a booming voice, announcing news to a crowd that has gathered to listen. (Loudly read 2-3 rumors).</p>
<p>17-18</p>
<p>A crowd of angry citizens are throwing rotten fruit at a fettered philosopher. She stands accused of slandering King Acastus. &quot;Shame on you for besmirching the name of the king!&quot;</p>
<p>19-20</p>
<p>A winged siren messenger glides overhead and lands nearby, singing happily. She delivers a message to an old woman, who immediately breaks down into tears at the terrible news. The siren giggles and flies away.</p>

<h1 id="rumors-in-mytros">Rumors in Mytros</h1>
<p>Mytros is the center of trade in Thylea, and so it is a place where rumors from all corners of the land can be heard. These rumors might be overheard on the streets, in marketplaces, or in taverns:</p>
<p>Rumors in the City of Mytros</p>
<p>[[/r d12]]</p>
<p>Rumor</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The Order of Sydon has demanded that the statues of the Five in the Great Agora be knocked down. King Acastus has refused them, for now.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The Great Games will be starting soon. Aresia has sent its best team in years and might embarrass Mytros. Even stranger, the Amazons of Themis have sent a delegation to the Games.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Gaius, the leader of the Order of Sydon, now has more influence over King Acastus than the goddess Vallus. How can such a thing come to be?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>King Pythor, the God of Battle, has abdicated his throne and no one knows where he has gone!</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The petrified victims of the Lady of Coins are being found in increasing numbers. King Acastus has been unable to stop her! Perhaps the Order of Sydon will help...</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>The great chimera of the Cerulean Gulf took a dozen victims aboard a merchant ship that was just one day&#39;s journey from Mytros.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Ekoh, an oread, is calling for war with Aresia again. After 500 years, she&#39;s still trying to get her betrothed back. She should <em>really</em> give it a rest.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>The most powerful merchant of Mytros, Lord Stavros, was banished to the Isle of Exiles for poisoning the son of his rival!</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>The Order of Sydon grows too powerful. They have seemingly unlimited wealth. Some think their wealth comes from the lost gygan ruins on the Island of Yonder.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The barbarian tribes of Indigo Island have been unusually quiet as of late. There have been no raids in recent years. What are they planning?</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Something has disturbed Kentimane. The Titan&#39;s great arms are on the move! Many have seen it!</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>The great vortex known as Charybdis has swallowed another ship. The ship was from Aresia. It was heading to Scorpion Island, full of young warrior monks going to their final trial.</p>
<p>p96</p>
<p>“_The news from Mytros is never good. Merchants in the Heartlands even have a saying: &quot;South winds carry sirens on wings with ill tidings.&quot;_”</p>
<p>— Kyrah, Goddess of Music</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-temple-district">The Temple District</h1>
<p>The Temple district is so named because it is home to both the ancient @UUID[.0000000000000006#m2.-temple-of-the-five]{Temple of the Five} and the newer @UUID[.0000000000000006#m1.-temple-of-sydon]{Temple of Sydon}. This is the center of religious and civic power in Mytros. It&#39;s also where the @UUID[.0000000000000006#m4.-the-great-palace]{Great Palace} can be found. Everything in this part of the city is impressive: the @UUID[.0000000000000006#m3.-the-theater-of-the-gods]{Theater of the Gods} can hold crowds of thousands, while the @UUID[.0000000000000006#m5.-the-academy]{Academy} is one of the greatest centers of learning anywhere in the world.</p>
<h2 id="m1-temple-of-sydon">M1. Temple of Sydon</h2>
<p>p96</p>
<p>Before you stands an imposing structure supported by carved stone columns. A series of steps carved to resemble crashing waves leads to the temple&#39;s entrance. Inside is an enormous central statue made of blue-green marble. It depicts a tall, wrathful man with three eyes and long gray hair. He wields an onyx black glaive. This is Sydon, the Lord of Storms.</p>
<p>This temple is the primary place of worship for Sydon in all of Thylea. The temple itself is a <em>peripteros</em> with 48 columns. It is built on a high podium that is accessed by an imposing set of steps shaped like ocean waves.</p>
<p>A stair at the center of the temple leads to several underground chambers where the paladins of Sydon meet to discuss the Order&#39;s many plans.</p>
<p>The Order of Sydon are headquartered here. They are a band of zealots who revere the ocean god Sydon above all others. They seek to the end all worship of the Five.</p>
<p>During the day, the temple is filled with citizens who come to hear the teachings of Sydon or receive blessings from the priests. During these busy periods, at least three @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{priests} of Sydon with six @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains} as protectors can be found within. At night, the temple proper is quiet, although the underground chambers are occupied by priests and soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="gaius-and-his-dragon">Gaius and His Dragon</h3>
<p>The highest-ranking member of the Order of Sydon is the paladin, @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#commander-gaius]{Commander Gaius}. During the day, he can often be found in the <em>Great Palace</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m4.-the-great-palace]{M4}), but at night he is usually here. Gaius is a true believer—a zealot who knows that the Five are false gods, thieves who stole the power of the true god, Sydon.</p>
<p>According to Gaius, the Five are useless pretenders: Pythor is a carousing drunkard; Kyrah composes terrible poetry; Vallus preens herself in an ivory tower; and Volkan is a crazy old dwarf who builds useless trinkets.</p>
<p>Once the heroes sail into the Cerulean Gulf on the <em>Ultros</em>, Gaius will move to the Island of Yonder, where the Order of Sydon have a base. Gaius is able to move between Yonder and Mytros easily due to a gift given to him by Sydon: <strong>Argyn</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.IlO2sLaK4hfJnCtJ]{Young Silver Dragon}).</p>
<p>Argyn was bred by Sydon at his tower, <em>Praxys</em> (S25). The dragon has been conditioned to believe that the Five are evil and that Sydon is the one and only force for good in the world. Argyn&#39;s presence in the city is the subject of widespread gossip and admiration, but the dragon&#39;s very existence infuriates Queen Vallus.</p>
<h2 id="m2-temple-of-the-five">M2. Temple of the Five</h2>
<p>p97</p>
<p>This relatively humble temple has an entrance with five stone columns. While it is smaller than the Temple of Sydon, it displays a much higher level of artistry, boasting lofty architecture and beautiful statuary. Intricate carvings embellish nearly every surface, complete with gilding and inlaid precious stones throughout.</p>
<p>This temple is the oldest civic building in Mytros. Elected representatives from the city districts of Mytros and the outlying villages meet in council here every new moon. However, the structure of civic life is increasingly dictated by the Order of Sydon, who believe that the Temple of the Five should be destroyed in order to appease the jealousy of the Lord of Storms.</p>
<p>Queen Vallus often visits here. During the day, she can be found at the palace, where she runs the city&#39;s civic affairs. She comes here at night to pray to her mother, Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn.</p>
<p>The temple is tended by five high priests (LG @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{priests}) and each high priest is attended by five @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{acolytes}. The priests provide all common temple services at no charge, including the @spell[lesser restoration|lesser] and @UUID[Item.CrfqCBjK8JdTHLqD]{greater restoration} spells.</p>
<h3 id="test-of-beauty-and-wisdom">Test of Beauty and Wisdom</h3>
<p>Outside of the temple during the day is a gang of young men who are admirers of Vallus. They are led by a vain young man named Sulla (LN @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{Acolyte}), the youngest son of the powerful merchant, Taran Neurdagon.</p>
<p>Sulla is enamored with Vallus, and spends all of his time trying to gain an audience with the goddess or catch a glimpse of her as she leaves the temple. Vallus finds the young man obnoxious. She ignores him entirely, much to his chagrin. The last time he tried to gain her attention, Vallus told him that she would agree to have an audience with him if he brought her a single mortal of unsurpassed beauty and wisdom.</p>
<p>Sulla has heard of the heroes&#39; exploits. He will single out the hero with the highest Charisma score and another with the highest Wisdom score. He begs the two heroes to accompany him to see Vallus. If the party agrees, then Sulla will take them directly to the queen.</p>
<p>Vallus is amused by the fact that the heroes have been roped in by Sulla, but she will humor them. Sulla presents the two heroes and extolls their beauty and wisdom, hoping to impress her. Vallus remains unmoved, pointing out the heroes&#39; various flaws.</p>
<p>This forces Sulla into the realm of hyperbole—the heroes are the wisest, most beautiful creatures ever to grace the city! Vallus reluctantly agrees, until finally, Sulla&#39;s unrequited affections have been completely transferred from the queen to the heroes.</p>
<p>Sulla proposes marriage to each of the heroes, offering a gold ring inset with a diamond worth 1,000 gp. Whichever hero agrees to marry the young man gets the ring. The agreement is not binding, but this entire situation greatly amuses the queen.</p>

<h2 id="m3-the-theater-of-the-gods">M3. The Theater of the Gods</h2>
<p>p98</p>
<p>A fine theater stands at the foot of the Temple Hill. Rows of seats built into the hillside are arranged around a polished marble stage. Behind the stage is a small building where stagehands and costumed actors come and go, carrying elaborate props.</p>
<p>The theater has a marble stage that extends in front of an orchestra pit. It has a four-tiered seating area that ascends the slope of the hill. The building behind the stage has rooms for actors to prepare and storage for props and movable scenery.</p>
<p>The Wine Festival.</p>
<p>The theater usually stands empty, but if the Wine Festival is happening in Mytros, then it will be busy for a full week. Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000005#event:-the-wine-festival]{Wine Festival} event in the <em>City of Estoria</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000005#e1.-public-amphitheater]{E1}) for details.</p>
<p>p98</p>
<p>“_The Wine Festival is my most cherished childhood memory. There was little else for a young tiefling to look forward to in Stygian Row._”</p>
<p>— Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria</p>
<h2 id="m4-the-great-palace">M4. The Great Palace</h2>
<p>p98</p>
<p>The Great Palace stands at the top of an impressive stone stairway. It is similar in appearance to the temples of the gods, except that its design emphasizes its civic function. Rather than statues to the gods, the palace is decorated with royal seals and with bronze tablets describing the legal codes of the city.</p>
<p>While not nearly as grand as the city&#39;s temples, this palace is still an impressive building. The stairs lead to an expansive antechamber, which connects to the throne room in the Royal Hall. This is where @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#acastus,-king-of-mytros]{King Acastus} can be found during the day.</p>
<p>The heroes are summoned here when they first arrive in the city. King Acastus is usually accompanied by his advisor, @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#chondrus]{Chondrus} (see appendix), his concubine <strong>Bella</strong> (CN @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}), and @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#commander-gaius]{Gaius}, commander of the Order of Sydon (see appendix). Acastus is always protected by five of his best centurions (LG @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains}).</p>
<h4 id="permission-to-enter-the-palace">Permission to Enter the Palace</h4>
<p>p98</p>
<p>The city guards generally restrict access to the Great Palace, but the heroes are allowed entry because they have been summoned by the king. After their audience with Queen Vallus, the heroes can revisit the palace whenever they like. Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006]{Summoned by the King} section for details.</p>
<h2 id="m5-the-academy">M5. The Academy</h2>
<p>p98</p>
<p>The sprawling campus grounds of the Academy bustle with activity. Over a dozen impressive marble buildings stand in rows, connected by paved, well-maintained pathways. Rich green lawns stretch between the pathways, and scholars can be seen reading, writing, and hotly debating all manner of subjects.</p>
<p>The Academy is spread throughout more than a dozen buildings. This is one of the greatest centers of learning not just in Thylea but most likely in all the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Great Library</strong></em> contains scrolls detailing knowledge on the flora and fauna of Thylea as well as information on topics such as metallurgy, alchemy, medicine, cartography, and almost any other imaginable subject.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Hall of Heroes</strong></em> is devoted to recording the heroic exploits of Thylea&#39;s heroes throughout the ages. Marble statues and busts of all of Thylea&#39;s heroes can be found here as well as scrolls of their histories and songs.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Schools of the Arcane</strong></em> consist of eight buildings devoted to the study of the eight schools of magic, each headed by an arcane master (LN @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{mages}).</p>
<p><em><strong>The Great Orrery</strong></em> is a building that contains a replica of the many planes of existence, represented as celestial spheres fashioned from bronze clockwork.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Hall of Debate</strong></em> provides a forum where any philosophy can be discussed without repercussions, even if it veers into the theological. Some of the greatest minds in Thylea can be found debating philosophy here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machaon</strong> (CG half-orc @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage})</li>
<li><strong>Chalcodon</strong> (LG elf @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble})</li>
<li><strong>Kerodotos</strong> (NG gnome @UUID[Actor.LOnJVi7HMkxrPq3x]{Priest})</li>
<li><strong>Atreus</strong> (CN tiefling @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captain})</li>
</ul>
<p>The Academy is well protected and if anyone is foolish enough to make trouble here, they will be quickly subdued by the arcane masters.</p>
<h3 id="event-the-great-debates">Event: The Great Debates</h3>
<p>The heroes are invited to participate in a series of philosophical debates at the <em>Hall of Debate.</em> Machaon, Chalcodon, Kerodotos, and Atreus all wish to test the intellectual mettle of the so-called &quot;Saviors of Thylea.&quot;</p>
<p>Each of the philosophers poses a paradoxical problem to the heroes and then awaits a response. There are no right answers to these puzzles: the philosophers want to see how the heroes behave in the debate. They will be impressed if the heroes take the exercise seriously. They will be disappointed if the heroes are sarcastic or silly in their responses.</p>
<p>Machaon.</p>
<p>The famed ship that brought the Dragonlord Adonis Neurdagon from the old lands to the lands of Thylea was the <em>Valorous.</em> The <em>Valorous</em> had sixty oars, a single mast, and a great prow. Over the centuries, it has decayed, and the Neurdagon family removed the old oars and planks, replacing it with newer and stronger timber. They replaced the mast when it was cracked in a storm, and they replaced the prow when the ship ran aground. After five centuries, every single piece of the <em>Valorous</em> has been replaced.</p>
<p>Is the <em>Valorous</em> now the same ship that once carried Adonis Neurdagon, or is she a different vessel?</p>
<p>Chalcodon.</p>
<p>Pythor is in a footrace with a tortoise. Pythor allows the tortoise a head start of 300 feet. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Pythor will have run 300 feet, bringing him to the tortoise&#39;s starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance of only 30 feet. It will then take Pythor some further time to catch up to those additional 30 feet, by which time the tortoise will have moved even farther ahead. It takes more time for Pythor to reach the third point, while the tortoise continues to maintain his lead...</p>
<p>Thus, whenever Pythor arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can catch the tortoise, despite running much faster. Clearly, this means that Pythor will never catch the tortoise. How do you explain this paradox?</p>
<p>Kerodotos.</p>
<p>A sphinx captures the young crown prince of Mytros. His mother comes to the sphinx and pleads for the return of her son. The sphinx replies that he will only return the prince safely if the mother can guess correctly whether or not he will indeed return the boy.</p>
<p>What is the problem here? As it turns out, there is no problem if the mother guesses that the sphinx will return him: if she is right, the boy is returned; if she is wrong, the sphinx keeps him.</p>
<p>However, if she answers that the sphinx will not return him, we end up with a paradox: if she is right and the sphinx never intended to return her child, then the sphinx has to return him, but in doing so, he breaks his word and contradicts the mother&#39;s answer. On the other hand, if she is wrong and the sphinx actually did intend to return the boy, then the sphinx must keep him, even though he did not intend to do so, thereby also breaking his word.</p>
<p>Atreus.</p>
<p>What is the nature of good and evil? Are they metaphysical properties that can be measured or changed? For example, if a man commits murder, his neighbors may call him evil. We may rightly say that he has evil properties. Hoping to atone for his act, this man may offer to pay the victim&#39;s family gold pieces to compensate for their loss. Now, let us say that the victim&#39;s family is satisfied by the payment, and they forgive him, saying that he is no longer evil. The man had evil properties before he made the payment, but now he does not.</p>
<p>If properties of objects cannot be created or destroyed but merely transferred, where did the evil properties go? Are the coins now evil? Is the family evil?</p>
<p>Reward.</p>
<p>For participating in the debate, the four great philosophers award the heroes signed copies of their books: <em>Machaon&#39;s Paradoxia</em>, <em>Chalcodon&#39;s Mathematika</em>, <em>Dialogues of Kerodotos</em>, and <em>Atreus&#39;s Metaphysika</em>. The books are worth 1 gp each, and each takes 1 day to read. Studying all four books grants proficiency in Arcana.</p>
<h2 id="m6-the-royal-gate">M6. The Royal Gate</h2>
<p>p99</p>
<p>This massive gate is wide enough to accommodate traffic moving in both directions. The towers that flank the gate are carved to seem as if they are made from the writhing forms of dozens of dragons.</p>
<p>This gate is always guarded by two @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains} and twenty @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{soldiers}. They are extremely disciplined and refuse to engage in conversation with passersby.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-noble-district">The Noble District</h1>
<p>The Noble District is loud, crowded, and colorful. Merchants from all across Thylea come here to ply their trades at the @UUID[.0000000000000006#m7.-the-great-agora]{Great Agora}, and to keep their wealth in the @UUID[.0000000000000006#m8.-the-vault-of-thylea]{Royal Bank}. Many of the wealthiest citizens of Mytros have real estate here.</p>
<h2 id="m7-the-great-agora">M7. The Great Agora</h2>
<p>p99</p>
<p>The Great Agora serves as the heart of both the Noble District and Mytros itself. A multitude of vendors sell all kinds of goods from across the continent. Their stalls are protected from the elements by rows of narrow, roofed structures, supported by columns. Sprawled out beyond the Great Agora are a number of large private estates, bathhouses, and temples.</p>
<p>Huge marble roofed colonnades or stoa provide shelter from the sun and the weather here. Twelve-foot-tall statues of the Five watch from the edges of the Agora. A new statue of Sydon stands at its center, and it towers higher than any of the statues of the Five.</p>
<p>Merchants from all over Thylea gather here during the day to trade and to sell their wares. All manner of goods can be found here; from foodstuffs such as fish, meat, wine, cheese; to animals such as cows, goats, and sheep; to pottery, clothes, and bronze equipment.</p>
<h3 id="grimmiks-armory">Grimmik&#39;s Armory</h3>
<p>p99</p>
<p>This large shop stands in a prominent location in the Great Agora. The walls and racks are filled with many varieties of polished bronze weapons, armor, and tools.</p>
<p>This shop is run by <strong>Grimmik</strong> (NG @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captain}), a retired centurion who sells adventuring gear and equipment. All non-magical weapons, armor, and tools from the 5th Edition <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#PHB">Player&#39;s Book</a> can be purchased here. He also has a single <em>mithral ingot</em> for sale, for 1,000 gp.</p>
<p>Grimmik is proud to have served the city of Mytros as a soldier, and he shows off several scars he earned in battles against the centaur tribes. He purchases all of his equipment from &quot;a small workshop&quot;in Estoria (@UUID[.0000000000000005#e9.-volkans-hall]{E9}).</p>
<h3 id="zorins-concoctions">Zorin&#39;s Concoctions</h3>
<p>p100</p>
<p>This small shop is tucked away in a shady corner of the marketplace. The inside of the shop is dusty and dark, and the walls are stocked with bottles of all kinds.</p>
<p>This shop is run by <strong>Zorin</strong> (TN @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage}), a disgruntled alchemist who washed out of the Academy (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m5.-the-academy]{M5}). He sells potions and lesser magic items.</p>
<p>Zorin spent years perfecting his potions, but all his teachers cared about were oratory skills. Unfortunately for him, he has a habit of insulting his audience in any long conversation. He opened his shop when it became clear that he had no future as a famous philosopher.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-menagerie">The Great Menagerie</h3>
<p>p100</p>
<p>This shop is set up in a large tent at one of the stoas. Inside the tent, it seems darker and colder than it should be. Dozens of cages line the walls.</p>
<p>A hooded man introduces himself to the heroes as the <strong>Collector</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage}). He travels throughout Thylea and collects exotic beasts and creatures. He offers to sell any of these creatures to interested heroes.</p>
<p>Caged Animals.</p>
<p>The cages hold a muzzled @UUID[Actor.fb80kDIqgON3qg9E]{Lion}, a muzzled @creature[Cheetah|MM], a hooded @UUID[Actor.n6BkkPYjmWHnYcBK]{Cockatrice}, a hooded @creature[Harpy|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords], a muzzled @UUID[Actor.UMJnQ5k1LEI5IDfT]{Brown Bear}, a trussed up @UUID[Actor.XCfvQueH2aXzTSRG]{Goatling}, and a trussed up young @UUID[Actor.U93UUfo9H42V9EXi]{Centaur}. The Collector offers to sell any of these creatures for a paltry sum of 100 gp, but he stresses that all sales are final.</p>
<p>With the exception of the young centaur, none of the creatures are trained. If released from their bonds, they will attack everyone around them. The young centaur will seek sanctuary at the Temple of Sydon.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>Treasure. There is a locked chest in the shop that contains 50 pp and the Collector&#39;s spellbook. The book contains all of the spells from the @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage} spell list. The chest can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with @UUID[Item.3uUg0fHZ48rdcNk8]{thieves&#39; tools}.</p>
<h2 id="m8-the-vault-of-thylea">M8. The Vault of Thylea</h2>
<p>p100</p>
<p>This beautiful bank doubles as a place of worship for Thylea, the Mother Goddess. The vault is sanctified by a circle of druids, who tend to a single great oak tree that grows from the central courtyard.</p>
<p>The bankers are elves who have devoted themselves to the Mother Goddess (TN @UUID[Actor.bwLvfvC1hzyUwujA]{druids}). For a monthly fee of 1 gp, anyone can entrust their money, jewelry, gems, or other treasures to the bankers, who will store them in the network of tunnels beneath the huge oak tree.</p>

<h4 id="law-and-order-in-mytros">Law and Order in Mytros</h4>
<p>p100</p>
<p>The laws of Mytros are primarily focused on how to punish someone who has been convicted of a crime. Jury trials determine whether a crime has been committed.</p>
<p>Debts.</p>
<p>If someone is delinquent in paying a debt, they have one week to pay it. After that, the debtor may be brought before the court forcibly. Unless the debtor pays the amount owed, the debtor is forced to serve the person he owes for a period of one day for every gold piece owed until the debt is paid.</p>
<p>Capital Offenses.</p>
<p>Murder, bribery of a court official, and treason are punishable by death by &quot;the Dragon.&quot;This is also the fate of anyone convicted of burning a building within the city (or on the outlying farms and settlements).</p>
<p>Theft and assault are all punished by enslavement as an oarsman aboard a ship chosen by the courts for a period no less than one year, up to a life sentence. The guilty party may choose death by &quot;the Dragon&quot;instead.</p>
<p>The Dragon.</p>
<p>This is an ancient @UUID[Actor.3EQi6OaKQJxahELq]{Chimera} that is kept imprisoned in a cavern below the courts. Two of its heads are muzzled, so it will only use its dragon fire on a victim tossed down to it for punishment.</p>
<h2 id="m9-the-courts-of-mytros">M9. The Courts of Mytros</h2>
<p>A broad, circular, white marble building stands apart from the other structures in this district. It&#39;s divided into three floors with rows of symmetrical windows. Several large bronze tablets at the entrance of the building describe the laws of the city.</p>
<p>The court building is circular and its interior has ten rows of seats that circle the entire inside circumference. At the center is a raised platform where both accused and the accuser stand. Court cases in Mytros are decided by jury, and the court can accommodate more than 300 jury members at once, if required.</p>
<h2 id="m10-the-bathhouse-of-vallus">M10. The Bathhouse of Vallus</h2>
<p>This bathhouse boasts two large baths, both the size of swimming pools. One is filled with hot water, while the other is filled with bracingly cold water. The connected buildings include two huge open air gymnasiums and dozens of smaller rooms for massages.</p>
<p>There are several bathhouses located in the city of Mytros, but all of them pale in significance when compared to this one. Queen Vallus had this bathhouse constructed two centuries ago, to celebrate victory in one of the Aresian campaigns. It is a place for exercise, business agreements, courtships, gossip—and even the occasional bath. While visiting the bathhouse is ostensibly free, there are several @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{acolytes} collecting donations.</p>
<h2 id="m11-the-neurdagon-estate">M11. The Neurdagon Estate</h2>
<p>Before you stands the most opulent villa in the city. Despite its great size, the house itself is difficult to see: the grounds are full of lush gardens, statuary, pools, fields, and a large hedge maze with what appears to be a great fountain shooting up from its center.</p>
<p>This is one of the most expensive villas in Mytros. It is home to the powerful merchant lord, <strong>Taran Neurdagon</strong> (LN @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}). He is descended from the ancient Dragonlord, Adonis Neurdagon, and he has access to immense wealth, although most of it is bound up in his sizable real estate holdings.</p>
<p>Taran doesn&#39;t allow uninvited guests, but he is willing to make an exception for heroes who are willing to perform a specific task for him: he wants someone to track down and destroy the so-called Lady of Coins.</p>
<p>Guardians.</p>
<p>The entrance to the estate is guarded by two @UUID[Actor.cW1mOTLOpYhPEfn0]{veterans}. These stalwarts will turn the heroes away unless they mention the Lady of Coins, at which point, they will invite the heroes into the main courtyard to await Taran. The estate is also patrolled by two @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains} and twelve @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{soldiers} from the Order of Sydon.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>Taran keeps 500 pp and 5,000 gp worth of gemstones, jewelry, and other trinkets in a locked chest in the study of his estate. The chest can be opened with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with @UUID[Item.3uUg0fHZ48rdcNk8]{thieves&#39; tools}. The chest also contains the deeds for over 6,000 acres of land in the regions surrounding Mytros.</p>
<h3 id="quest-the-lady-of-coins">Quest: The Lady of Coins</h3>
<p>When Taran eventually appears, he explains his predicament to the heroes. The Lady of Coins is a self-styled folk hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor of <em>Stygian Row</em>. She has an intense hatred for the minotaur slave trade and aggressively attacks those who try to make an honest profit. Taran admits that he makes a large portion of his wealth from the minotaur slave trade, so his business suffers more than most.</p>
<p>Taran explains that the Lady is cursed—she is a medusa who petrifies anyone who crosses her. Further, he explains that minotaurs are violent beasts with limited intelligence who revel in bloodshed, and the fact that the Lady of Coins has an affinity for them speaks volumes about her character. Taran also suspects that she is behind the Cult of the Snake, a thieves&#39; guild deeply involved with smuggling and murder.</p>
<p>Reward.</p>
<p>Taran offers the heroes 5,000 gp for the Lady&#39;s head. He is willing to pay as much as 10,000 gp, if pressed. He advises the heroes to begin their search for the Lady in Stygian Row.</p>
<h2 id="m12-the-great-gardens">M12. The Great Gardens</h2>
<p>This verdant garden is circled by a ring of immense, ancient oak trees. The air around you is sweet with the scents of flowers, although many of them are unrecognizable to you. You can hear loud voices down one of the many paths that wander into the green spaces.</p>
<p>The Great Gardens of Mytros are held to be the most beautiful in all Thylea, boasting many paths, trees, flowers, ponds, and fountains to heal the restless spirit. The gardens are surrounded by perfectly-ordered oak trees, all of which are five centuries old. These oaks were planted when the city was founded.</p>
<p><strong>Vitalis</strong> (LN halfling @UUID[Actor.Sbjw2JFBT5oXBTuj]{Commoner}) resides here. This corpulent halfling is sometimes called &quot;Vitalis the Fat&quot;or &quot;Vitalis the Fragrant&quot;(although never to his face). Many believe him to be the wisest mortal in Mytros. Vitalis lives, sleeps, and eats in the gardens, and he is well-fed by his many admirers.</p>
<p>However, his personal habits don&#39;t seem particularly wise, as he never cleans himself, and he dresses in rags.</p>
<p>He also flatulates, belches, and harasses everyone who passes by. Some of his favorite insults include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like your face caught fire... and someone tried to put it out with a hammer!</li>
<li>You&#39;re so ugly that when your mother sent you out to play, they fined her for littering!</li>
<li>Mirrors reveal many things, but they cannot talk... and lucky for you, they can&#39;t laugh, either!</li>
<li>You there! Turn around. Hmmm... I can tell that you&#39;re a centaur, but all I can see is the rear end!</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeking Advice.</p>
<p>Despite his foul demeanor, Vitalis deserves his reputation. He gives out sound advice to anyone who pays him in fine food or wine. He devours the offerings and then answers questions in a drunken haze, one question per person who feeds him. Treat this as the equivalent of the @UUID[Item.yv9dHlqCkRMfBJ6p]{divination} spell.</p>
<p>On subsequent or follow-up questions, he will shoo interrogators away, tell them that they must make their own mistakes if they are to learn anything, and probably pass wind from one end or the other.</p>
<h2 id="m13-the-commerce-gate">M13. The Commerce Gate</h2>
<p>p102</p>
<p>This gate is decorated with beautiful statuary and surrounded by lush greenery. The stairway beneath the gate leads up to a verdant plateau: the Noble District.</p>
<p>This is a sister to the Royal Gate. The road here is twice as wide as the way to the Royal Gate, because it has to accommodate mercantile traffic coming and going to the Harbor. The gate is guarded by two @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains} who keep an eye out for riff-raff from @UUID[.0000000000000006#stygian-row]{Stygian Row}.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-harbor">The Harbor</h1>
<p>p102</p>
<p>The harbor of Mytros is as grand as the rest of the city. You see ships sailing in and out of the bay, while others remain tied up at docks. On one side of the harbor stands an immense bronze statue of a muscular man. It&#39;s clear that another such colossus once stood opposite this one, but it now lies in ruins.</p>
<p>The harbor of Mytros is the largest in Thylea. Dozens of ships that ply the sea lanes of the Cerulean Gulf can be found anchored in the bay, while others are in dry dock, undergoing repairs.</p>
<h2 id="m14-colossus-of-pythor">M14. Colossus of Pythor</h2>
<p>p102</p>
<p>This bronze colossus is recognizable as a young version of Pythor, God of Battle and current King of Estoria. The statue&#39;s head is wreathed by a crown of leaves. Despite its relaxed stance and serene gaze, the statue seems alert to anything that might threaten the city.</p>
<p>This colossus is one of the wonders of Thylea. The twin colossi were constructed before the First War with the aid of Volkan, God of the Forge. In times of need, the statues could be activated to defend Mytros. Refer to the Colossus of Pythor section for details.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords/Chapter3_ColossusOfPythor_Page102.webp" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="m15-the-ruined-colossus">M15. The Ruined Colossus</h2>
<p>p103</p>
<p>Although this bronze colossus lies in ruins, it seems that it once depicted the city&#39;s patron goddess, Mytros. A large pyre blazes at the statue&#39;s feet, and a small crowd has gathered around it.</p>
<p>This colossus was destroyed two centuries ago, and the tale is still told with horror by the people of Mytros. The Kraken, a terrifying creature from the Forgotten Sea, attacked the city during a powerful storm. The twin colossi wrestled the creature back into the ocean, but the Colossus of Mytros was torn apart in the struggle. She returned to her guard post and collapsed into ruin.</p>
<h2 id="m16-the-dockyard">M16. The Dockyard</h2>
<p>p103</p>
<p>This bustling dockyard boasts dozens of galleys, each of which bristles with banks of oars. Many of the ships seem to have sustained serious damage recently. You can hear a chorus of hammering from the drydocks.</p>
<p>The dockyard is always bustling during the day. Although many merchants trade and bank in the <em>Noble District</em>, many come dockside to work and barter. There are bargains to be had with the many ships that arrive here from across Thylea. There are also more than a dozen drydocks where ships are repaired.</p>
<h3 id="sacrificial-stockyard">Sacrificial Stockyard</h3>
<p>There is a stockyard here that sells sacrificial animals for the ceremonies that are customarily performed before ships embark on ocean voyages. The heroes may purchase such animals and sacrifice them to gain favor with the gods, or to avoid confrontations at sea.</p>

<p>p103</p>
<p>This crowded marketplace smells strongly of brine. Barrels of freshly-caught fish line every stall, many of which have just been unloaded from nearby ships.</p>
<p>The fish market is especially crowded in the afternoon, when the fishing boats start returning from the Cerulean Gulf. Fish of every sort can be found on sale here, including unusual catches like sharks, eels, and octopuses. Quality fishing supplies can also be purchased here, including bait, tackle, and nets.</p>
<p>The Ancient Mariner.</p>
<p>One of the merchants here is a dwarf who has sailed Thylea&#39;s oceans for over 500 years. His name is <strong>Samuel</strong> (TN @UUID[Actor.cW1mOTLOpYhPEfn0]{Veteran}), and although he&#39;s lost dozens of comrades to the treachery of the seas, he still makes sacrifices to the Lord of Storms. Samuel has lots of useful sailing advice to offer to heroes who are willing to listen to him. One of his favorite stories to tell is about a legendary city on the back of a dragonturtle that wanders the Forgotten Sea.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="stygian-row">Stygian Row</h1>
<p>p103</p>
<p>This low-lying district is vastly different from the rest of the city. Its clogged, stinking streets are filthy and poorly maintained. Ruffians and vagrants shout threatening words at you as you pass. Signs of drunkeness, violence, and open debauchery are everywhere.</p>
<p>Stygian Row is a wretched hive of scoundrels and sellswords. This is a den of iniquity, where any vice may be freely indulged, and Lutheria is openly revered. This part of the city never sleeps, as drunken revelers parade through the streets at all hours of the night, and merchants hawk their illicit goods in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Tiefling Enclave.</p>
<p>The district gets its name from the word that many Thyleans use for tieflings—&quot;Stygians.&quot;Five hundred years ago, this district was established as an enclave where tieflings could be corralled, because they were thought to be untrustworthy spies of Lutheria.</p>
<p>Half-Orc Enclave.</p>
<p>Half-orcs in Thylea are not mistrusted the way they often are in other lands. When the original settlers learned that no orcs lived in Thylea, many of the half-orcs among them realized that they needed to live in close proximity to keep their bloodline alive. They decided to settle alongside the tieflings.</p>
<p>Both half-orcs and tieflings are common in this district, though neither race is particularly villainous, especially when compared to the loathsome humans who manage the <em>Minotaur Market</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m21.-the-minotaur-market]{M21}).</p>

<p>The woman is <strong>Ambrosia</strong> (NG siren @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}), the owner of this tavern. She genuinely seeks to entertain her guests with fine music, wine, and &quot;interesting&quot;company. Unlike similar establishments, she does not discriminate against satyrs, minotaurs, or centaurs, but she does prefer to entertain rich clients and famous heroes.</p>
<p>When engaged in longer conversations, Ambrosia makes it clear that she despises Julius, the owner of <em>The Satyr&#39;s Tail</em>, who used to send thugs to collect &quot;protection&quot;money. Now, she employs <strong>Vorena</strong> (LN half-orc @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain}), a taciturn former centurion, to protect her establishment. Vorena does her job well.</p>
<p>Each of Ambrosia&#39;s escorts claims to trace their lineage to a god or a nymph, so that clients can pick their preferred flavor of &quot;immortality.&quot;</p>
<p>Son of Pythor.</p>
<p>One of the escorts is <strong>Kalistor</strong> (CG @UUID[Actor.zU7UuNC3lb0FLwLE]{Spy}), who is actually a child of Pythor. He has met his father only once, and they didn&#39;t get along. He is quick to fall in love with any hero who has 18+ Strength.</p>
<h3 id="quest-kidnapped-children">Quest: Kidnapped Children</h3>
<p>Kalistor spends his time in Mytros trying to undermine the <em>Temple of Lutheria</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m20.-temple-of-lutheria]{M20}). He believes that Trellus and Septia are keeping children locked in their wine cellar for use in human sacrifices. He has no rewards to offer, but he emphasizes that if the rumors are true, then rescuing the children would be the right thing to do.</p>

<p>p105</p>
<p>The interior of this crowded tavern is thick with smoke and various unpleasant smells. Many of the patrons appear to be half-orcs, while others are obviously sailors. It&#39;s difficult to walk through the tavern without tripping over its many inebriated patrons.</p>
<p>The sailors who come to this tavern drink to forget what they&#39;ve seen on the waters of the Cerulean Gulf. The wine here may be over-sweet and watered-down, but it&#39;s also cheap and plentiful.</p>
<p>The taproom is filled with smoke and smells of fish and unwashed bodies. The tavern is run by Julius (CE @UUID[Actor.cW1mOTLOpYhPEfn0]{Veteran}), a nasty old man and former slave trader. He had his own galley before he ran afoul of Cerulean pirates and lost everything, including his left arm. He doesn&#39;t like seeing his patrons bothered. If the heroes disturb his regulars, he&#39;ll send three of his bouncers (CE @UUID[Actor.RE2KrDh2qupITiSn]{thugs}) to remove them from the premises.</p>
<p><strong>Fryxon</strong>, a @UUID[Actor.gYGismFvuOX2rEUe]{Satyr}, befriended Julius a few years back. He provides music for the tavern. If a fight breaks out or the bouncers need help in removing someone, Fryxon will use his <em>pan pipes</em> to help put aggressors to sleep.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Snake.</p>
<p>This is one of the only places to find information about the Cult of the Snake. Fryxon loves to cause mischief, and if asked about the Cult of the Snake, he will loudly introduce the questioners to Grecos and Nero (see below).</p>
<h3 id="tavern-patrons">Tavern Patrons</h3>
<p>The tavern is crowded day and night by sailors, bandits, thieves, mercenaries, and other miscreants.</p>
<p>Varkon&#39;s Crew.</p>
<p>One of the captains is <strong>Varkon</strong> (CN @UUID[Actor.2WcCdN8Z0emHlTsK]{Bandit captain}), a half-orc, who is accompanied by a half-dozen of his sailors (CN @UUID[Actor.Bem18BiSuNBS60Zh]{bandits}). They are a rowdy bunch, boasting about their adventures in the Cerulean Gulf. Varkon often works for the Lady of Coins, and he isn&#39;t afraid to drop her name as a threat. He knows the route that leads to the @UUID[.0000000000000009#island-of-the-dragon]{Island of the Dragon}, and the Lady of Coins uses him to deliver petrified musicians and performers to Hexia. Varkon also knows where to find the Cult of the Snake&#39;s secret entrance into the Colossus of Pythor.</p>
<p>Grecos and Nero.</p>
<p>Another table is occupied by two thieves who are members of the Cult of the Snake. They always visit <em>The Satyr&#39;s Tail</em> after successful robberies in order to celebrate by spending their ill-got gains. <strong>Grecos</strong> and <strong>Nero</strong> (CE @UUID[Actor.zU7UuNC3lb0FLwLE]{spies}) are brothers who love to insult the other patrons with sarcastic remarks. They are also fiercely loyal to the Lady of Coins and, if they notice the heroes investigating the Lady, they will split up. Grecos will let the Lady of Coins know that the heroes are interested; Nero will try to follow the heroes.</p>
<p>Wine Merchants.</p>
<p><strong>Trellus</strong> and <strong>Septia</strong> (apparently NE @UUID[Actor.Sbjw2JFBT5oXBTuj]{commoners} when they appear in public) from the <em>Temple of Lutheria</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m20.-temple-of-lutheria]{M20}) sometimes drop by to deliver new wine to Julius. They are looking for mercenaries to help them track down some missing wine caravans.</p>
<h2 id="m20-temple-of-lutheria">M20. Temple of Lutheria</h2>
<p>p105</p>
<p>This small temple stands out from its surroundings due to the obvious wealth that has been lavished on it.</p>
<p>The temple interior is dominated by dozens of statues of a grinning, dark-eyed woman with a scythe. Casks and painted jugs of wine are stacked along the walls. The temple is filled with a sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>The temple is maintained by a family of wine merchants, keen to promote the worship of Lutheria so as to serve their business interests in the city. The high priest is <strong>Trellus</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.FMsJr7GquiPhOJKh]{Cult Fanatic}), and he is served by six @UUID[Actor.DeD0njf9CfukCiBL]{cultists} in black robes. His sister and lover, <strong>Septia</strong> (CE @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage}), secretly plots to become queen of the city. The siblings officiate in ritual kidnappings and human sacrifices, performed every full moon, although they are careful not to kill anyone who might be missed.</p>
<p>Admirers of the Horn.</p>
<p>If the two discover that the heroes have the @UUID[Item.4w1maAAU0mEoWuS6]{Horn of Balmytria}, they will offer to buy it for 5,000 gp. If the heroes refuse, then they will secretly plot to kill the party and take it.</p>
<h3 id="quest-the-missing-casks">Quest: The Missing Casks</h3>
<p>Recently, several wine caravans that should have reached the temple have gone missing. The siblings believe that bandits are hiding out in the woods near the <em>Vineyards of Mytros</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m23.-the-vineyards-of-mytros]{M23}). They offer 2,000 gp if the bandits can be delivered to them alive (for use in ritual sacrifices), or 1,000 gp for the bandits&#39; heads.</p>
<h3 id="wine-cellar-of-missing-children">Wine Cellar of Missing Children</h3>
<p>The wine cellar of the Temple of Lutheria is a place of horrors. Trellus and Septia currently have thirteen children (NG @UUID[Actor.Sbjw2JFBT5oXBTuj]{commoners}) locked away in the cellar, which Septia keeps warded with the @UUID[Item.NC7khdgUdkFTJFDc]{silence} spell.</p>
<p>The children&#39;s parents were sacrificed to Lutheria, and their bones are scattered throughout the cellar. The siblings intend to induct the children into their cult—and sacrifice those who resist. If the children are freed, they can be sent to Queen Vallus for protection.</p>
<h2 id="m21-the-minotaur-market">M21. The Minotaur Market</h2>
<p>p105</p>
<p>This marketplace is filled with bronze cages, which surround a central, raised platform. A rank barnyard odor assaults your senses. Over a dozen unwashed minotaurs have been locked within the cages. The minotaurs are physically fit but filthy, and many have fresh bruises and superficial cuts from battle.</p>
<p>In this market, @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{Minotaur} slaves can be purchased for 100-250 gp each. There are usually a dozen specimens on display, all of which were recently captured.</p>
<p>There are three separate slave houses close to the market. Each is owned by a wealthy merchant who specializes in the sale of minotaurs. The minotaurs are kept in filthy conditions—no better than cattle pens.</p>
<h4 id="minotaurs-in-mytros">Minotaurs In Mytros</h4>
<p>p106</p>
<p>The citizens of Mytros treat minotaurs as little more than livestock, using them as opponents to be slaughtered in the funeral games held to honor the recently deceased. This practice is mirrored and multiplied in the Great Games, which often require hundreds of the creatures. Although some minotaurs used in this manner are captured from tribes in the steppes, others are captively bred for the task. These &quot;domesticated&quot;minotaurs live almost universally in squalid conditions unfit for sentient creatures.</p>
<p>Queen Vallus has long sought to end this barbaric practice in the city, but King Acastus and the Order of Sydon have undermined her at every turn. There were a few centuries where minotaurs were merely outlawed from the city, but widespread smuggling and other skullduggery have ensured that the practice of slavery is alive and well.</p>
<p>The party may seek to liberate the minotaurs in the market, but it will cause chaos in this district and infuriate the Order of Sydon. The queen would strongly approve of such actions, but most of the district&#39;s citizens are cowards who prefer to maintain the status quo.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-bullbug-the-minotaur">Encounter: Bullbug the Minotaur</h3>
<p>One of the minotaurs for sale is @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#bullbug]{Bullbug} (NG @UUID[Actor.P1kQCEodGIdtHop1]{Minotaur Hero}), a large fellow even by minotaur standards.</p>
<p>Bullbug calls out to the heroes, asserting that he would make an excellent addition to their party. Despite the conditions in the market, he is confident and friendly.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords/Chapter3_BullbugTheMinotaur_Page106.webp" alt="Bullbug the Minotaur" title="Bullbug the Minotaur"></p>
<p>Bullbug the Minotaur</p>
<h3 id="maximus-the-merciless">Maximus the Merciless</h3>
<p><strong>Maximus</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.WKlDH3u8kCxF5quF]{Gladiator}) is the slavemaster who runs the Minotaur Market. He keeps order in the market with the aid of twelve thugs, and he heaps abuse upon the minotaurs. If any of the heroes are minotaurs and they pass through the market, he mistakes them for escaped slaves. In this case, he approaches the hero and attempts to shackle them, berating them for getting loose.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>Maximus carries 750 gp in his coin purse. He also carries a permit which allows him to sell minotaurs, which was issued by Commander Gaius of the Order of Sydon. Technically, the permit allows him to transfer @reward[oaths of service|Oath of Service] to his customers, as outright slavery is officially outlawed in Mytros.</p>

<h1 id="the-city-borders">The City Borders</h1>
<h2 id="m22-mount-volkan">M22. Mount Volkan</h2>
<p>p106</p>
<p>The black, rocky crags of Mount Volkan loom over the northern quarter of the city. At its summit, the great mountain dips into a gently-sloping basin. Although trees grow in abundance on the mountain&#39;s slopes, the interior basin has been cleared to create flat fields.</p>
<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#the-great-games]{The Great Games} are held at the peak of Mount Volkan. The proving grounds for the Games are inside the basinlike crater of the extinct volcano. The Great Games are held outside of the city walls, because they are held sacred as a neutral, non-political event. All of the Kings of Thylea send their best to compete in the Games.</p>
<h2 id="m23-the-vineyards-of-mytros">M23. The Vineyards of Mytros</h2>
<p>p106</p>
<p>You come to a vast field with row upon row of grape vines. Although there are no obvious signs of caretakers, the vines are thriving, and fruit hangs heavy. The plant life surrounding the vineyard is healthy—but nowhere near as green and lush.</p>
<p>These vineyards are owned by a dozen mercantile families that live within the city. For centuries, these vineyards have been cared for by a tribe of @UUID[Actor.gYGismFvuOX2rEUe]{satyrs}.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-the-fey-glade">Encounter: The Fey Glade</h3>
<p>p107</p>
<p>Following the road through the vineyards, you come to a wooded pass flanked by two large marble statues of leering nymphs. Passing between the statues, you enter a foggy dell carpeted by dead leaves and wild rose bushes. In the mist ahead, you hear the sounds of musical laughter and revelry. It seems that you&#39;ve stumbled upon a glade of fey creatures.</p>
<p>This is where the caravans meant for the <em>Temple of Lutheria</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m20.-temple-of-lutheria]{M20}) have gone. Satyrs have been waylaying the caravans and stockpiling wine casks in the glade. <strong>Boreas</strong> (NE @UUID[Actor.QR79OGEZOnRI7VDv]{Satyr Minstrel}) is here, playing a gentle tune upon his enchanted harp. He is accompanied by his brothers, three @UUID[Actor.gYGismFvuOX2rEUe]{satyrs}, who are drinking wine and entertaining a @UUID[Actor.rvB99J5BhBbba82z]{Dryad}. Boreas has permanently &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] a @UUID[Actor.sMwip9yi9d07TKuf]{Water Elemental}, which tends to the vineyards for him.</p>
<h4 id="the-four-winds-boreas">The Four Winds: Boreas</h4>
<p>p107</p>
<p>Kyrah recognizes Boreas as one of <em>The Four Winds,</em> a troupe of fey bards who broke into the Temple of the Five and stole her divine instruments. The @item[Boreal harp|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords] is one such instrument. Recovering it by force will be a challenge.</p>
<p>There is a [[/r 1d100]]{75%} chance that the harp will be destroyed in the battle, leaving behind a set of <em>nymph-hair strings</em>.</p>
<p>Keepers of the Vineyards.</p>
<p>Boreas claims that the wine merchants struck a bargain with him years ago, for which he and his brothers were to be compensated in wine. The terms of payment were vague, but the satyrs interpreted it as one cask per month, as long as the vineyards of Mytros remain fruitful. They claim that they were the ones who enchanted the vineyards, centuries ago, ensuring that the vines would flourish.</p>
<p>Trellus and Septia.</p>
<p>The merchants, Trellus and Septia, are only humans with short memories, and they&#39;ve broken the oath made by their ancestors. Boreas mocks the siblings, claiming that Lutheria will swallow their souls as punishment. He offers the heroes his @item[Instrument of the Muse; Boreal Harp|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|Boreal harp] if they will bring him the heads of the treacherous merchants. If the heroes comply, he will smash the harp before handing it over.</p>
<h2 id="m24-the-soldiers-gate">M24. The Soldier&#39;s Gate</h2>
<p>p107</p>
<p>This heavily-trafficked gate leads northward into the Heartlands. During the day, the road is filled with centurions, pilgrims, and merchants traveling between Mytros and Estoria. At night, the road is patrolled by soldiers with torches, who rotate shifts between a series of stone guard towers.</p>
<p>This gate is always guarded by two captains and twelve soldiers. They are replaced each hour by an identical squad from one of the towers along the road.</p>
<h2 id="m25-the-harp-bridge">M25. The Harp Bridge</h2>
<p>p107</p>
<p>This stone bridge is suspended from cascading rays of bright copper wire. When the wind catches the wire, it produces concordant, harp-like melodies. The songs are joined by a chorus of beautiful voices from nearby.</p>
<p>This bridge is the gathering point for a flock of sirens. There are over twenty sirens in the flock, and they live in the estates to the west of the bridge. They gather here throughout the day to sing together, and their collective mood fluctuates from one day to the next.</p>
<p>There is a [[/r 1d100]]{50%} chance that they will be either joyful or mournful. On days when they are joyful, commerce in the city flourishes. On days when they are mournful, the city is more superstitious.</p>

<h1 id="the-colossus-of-pythor">The Colossus of Pythor</h1>
<p>The <em>Colossus of Pythor</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m14.-colossus-of-pythor]{ M14}) is a hollow structure, but it is sealed and guarded. In theory, only King Acastus has the password and key to enter the Colossus but, unbeknownst to Acastus, the Lady of Coins has tunneled up from the sewers. Her servants have built a secret entrance into the interior of the great bronze statue, allowing her to use this as a base of operations.</p>
<h2 id="cult-of-the-snake">Cult of the Snake</h2>
<p>The Cult is a thieves&#39; guild that operates in the city&#39;s shadows. They have a headquarters deep within the aqueducts. The cultists have recently been breaking into the homes of wealthy citizens, stealing everything of value, and leaving entire families literally petrified.</p>
<p>The leader of the cult is a medusa who calls herself &quot;the Lady of Coins.&quot;She is the sister of Thesilea, the queen of the Amazons, but she fled the Island of Themis after a failed attempt to depose her sister. Refer to the @UUID[.0000000000000008#island-of-themis]{Themis} in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008]{Cerulean Gulf} for details.</p>
<p>Servants of Hexia.</p>
<p>Moxena and her minions serve the green dragon, Hexia, and they ferry their spoils to her by ship once per year. Hexia has peculiar tastes: she allows the cultists to keep almost everything of material value, but she collects musical instruments and musicians. They are transported to her in petrified form, and she releases them for entertainment at her leisure.

<h2 id="c1-main-entrance-right-leg">C1. Main Entrance (Right Leg)</h2>
<p>p108</p>
<p>A circular door opens to reveal a small chamber with a spiral staircase reaching upwards. Both the staircase and the walls of the room are forged from bronze, but unlike the statue&#39;s exterior, this brightly-polished metal has not been weathered by the passage of time.</p>
<p>The locked and guarded main entrance is in the heel of the right foot of the colossus. Two @UUID[Actor.E0oEn9VKtQHztg9z]{marble golems}, each resembling Pythor, flank the door on the outside. If someone tries to open the door without first speaking the password, one golem&#39;s head will turn to look at the intruder menacingly. If the intruder continues, the marble golems will attack.</p>
<p>The door is locked with arcane lock. It can be picked with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check with @UUID[Item.3uUg0fHZ48rdcNk8]{thieves&#39; tools}. If the arcane lock is dispelled or suppressed with a knock spell, the DC lowers to 15. The spell can be temporarily negated by speaking the password, &quot;ADONIS.&quot;This password can be obtained from Vallus.</p>
<p>Inside the leg, a spiral staircase ascends to the room in the belly of the colossus (@UUID[.0000000000000006#c3.-the-statues-belly]{C3}).</p>
<h2 id="c2-secret-entrance-left-leg">C2. Secret Entrance (Left Leg)</h2>

<p>A small hole has been bored through the sole of the colossus&#39; foot. Inside is a room that has apparently been melted out from the solid bronze. A single thug sits at a wooden table by the hole, keeping watch.</p>
<p>This entrance has been bored from the sewer system, and the room was created with the @UUID[Item.WTuMBBRdQDBwySXK]{disintegrate} spell. The hole is only two feet wide, and a makeshift rope ladder hangs down from the room in the belly of the colossus (@UUID[.0000000000000006#c3.-the-statues-belly]{C3}). A @UUID[Actor.RE2KrDh2qupITiSn]{Thug} guards the entrance.

<h2 id="c3-the-statues-belly">C3. The Statue&#39;s Belly</h2>
<p>p108</p>
<p>This circular room contains a series of coiled bronze tubes that snake around and overlap in a large knot that takes up most of the chamber. One set of pipes stretches a few feet off the ground and has four different colored valves: yellow, red, black, and green. Several minotaurs and a vicious-looking woman wearing an eye patch are keeping watch in here.</p>
<p>The belly of the colossus is filled with large tubes that resemble intestines. These tubes do serve an important function for the colossus, supplying the chemical biles and humors that power the automaton. The pipes transport the biles to all of its extremities.</p>
<p>The Bile Traps.</p>
<p>There are four different biles: red, green, black, and yellow. Some of these are poisonous to humanoids. The four valves in the chamber give access to the different types of bile. When any bile comes into contact with air, it turns into a gas and retains its coloration. Opening a valve takes an action, and the room fills with gas in the next round:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Valve 1 (Red Bile).</p>
<p>This odorless gas will cause fits of hilarity. Anyone who breathes it in must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be considered &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned]. Affected creatures are &amp;Reference[condition=incapacitated] by a fit of laughter for 10 rounds. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shake off the effect on a success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Valve 2 (Green Bile).</p>
<p>This has a pleasant smell, but it has a slow, progressive poisoning effect. Anyone who breathes in green bile vapor must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned]. One round after being &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned], the victim will cough up mucus and take 10 ([[/damage 3d6 type=necrotic]]) damage. On the next round, the victim will cough up blood and take 21 ([[/damage 6d6 type=necrotic]]) damage. On the third round, the victim will go into a spasm, taking 10 ([[/damage 3d6 type=necrotic]]) damage and become &amp;Reference[condition=paralyzed]. Each round after being &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned], a victim can take an action to try and resist: a DC 15 Constitution saving throw stops the poisoning process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Valve 3 (Black Bile).</p>
<p>This vapor causes extreme sadness. Anyone who breathes it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned] for one minute. While &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned], they become utterly despondent, they have disadvantage on saving throws, and their speed is halved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Valve 4 (Yellow Bile).</p>
<p>This valve releases a harmless yellow gas that smells like rotten eggs. The foul smell lingers on clothing for one day, causing disadvantage on all Charisma checks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{minotaurs} in here, along with the female @UUID[Actor.2WcCdN8Z0emHlTsK]{Bandit Captain}. They are all resistant to the bile vapors, granting them advantage on saving throws against the poisons. The captain tries to open the valves one at a time while the minotaurs engage intruders. The heroes can shut off one of the valves by using an action.</p>

<h2 id="c4-the-statues-torso">C4. The Statue&#39;s Torso</h2>
<p>p100</p>
<p>This curved, oblong chamber is situated between two staircases. Small circular holes are visible throughout the walls, ceiling, and floor of the room. Round glass doors at each end separate staircases from the chamber. The western staircase leads downward, while the eastern staircase leads upward. Two minotaurs stand watch by the east door, apparently unfazed by the sharp, acidic tang that pervades the air.</p>
<p>The torso chamber is a large cavity that resembles a stomach. The doors at either end are airtight, with small glass portholes built into them, and they are sealed shut when the heroes arrive. Pipes enter the room from both the ceiling and the floor.</p>
<p>The Acid Trap.</p>
<p>This chamber is where the gasses that power the colossus are made. When the colossus is active, a powerful acidic liquid is pumped into the chamber and then heated to become a gas. This process can be activated by using an emergency lever on the outside of each of the exits to the chamber. If either lever is pulled, the doors seal and acidic liquid will pour into the chamber.</p>
<p>It takes two rounds for the chamber to fill. Anyone inside the chamber during this time takes 21 ([[/damage 6d6 type=acid]]) damage per round. On the third round, the walls of the room heat up to turn the liquid into gas. Anyone touching the walls takes 21 ([[/damage 6d6 type=fire]]) damage in addition to the 21 ([[/damage 6d6 type=acid]]) damage. On the fourth round, the acid becomes gas and is then pumped out of the room. At this point, the doors open.</p>
<p>The process can be ended at any time by pulling either lever to the off position, which immediately drains the chamber and opens the doors. When the liquid is being heated, the only other way to open the doors is to use a knock spell or to succeed at a DC 30 Strength check to force them. If the doors are opened in any way, the process ends and the room immediately drains.</p>
<p>Two @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{minotaurs} wait on the east side of the chamber, watching for intruders. They wait until at least two visible intruders are inside the acid chamber. Then they move outside to pull the emergency lever. Anyone outside of the chamber at the west end will see the emergency lever move into the &quot;ON&quot;position, the doors will seal, and they can clearly see what is happening to their companions through the porthole.</p>
<p>Heroes outside the chamber can try to pull the lever to the &quot;OFF&quot;position by testing their strength against the minotaurs. The minotaurs have advantage as they are helping each other, but the heroes can do the same. Once the chamber has been re-opened the minotaurs will rush forward to attack.</p>
<h2 id="c5-the-statues-chest">C5. The Statue&#39;s Chest</h2>
<p>p110</p>
<p>The main feature of this room is a bizarre, top-heavy furnace that tapers to a rounded point. It hangs in the center of the chamber from a series of pipes that sprout from its top. Two thugs are busying themselves with the furnace&#39;s operation while another two stand ready at the entrance from below.</p>
<p>These are four cronies of the Lady of Coins (CE @UUID[Actor.RE2KrDh2qupITiSn]{thugs}).</p>
<p>Heart of the Colossus.</p>
<p>The furnace here looks like a heart, and it helps to power the colossus. It is usually dark and cold unless the colossus is active. However, if the thugs hear any intruders below, they will power it up using a lever on the east side of the chamber.</p>
<p>The Fire Trap.</p>
<p>Once active, the furnace begins to rumble rhythmically, once per round. The thugs will leave the furnace door open so that every time it &quot;beats,&quot;a jet of fire explodes into the room. The blast of fire extends from the opening in a 5 ft. wide stream to hit the back wall. The flames do 10 ([[/damage 3d6 type=fire]]) damage. Anything within 5 ft. of the back wall is engulfed in flames. The thugs know where the flames go, so they easily avoid the blast.</p>
<h2 id="c6-the-statues-head">C6. The Statue&#39;s Head</h2>
<p>p110</p>
<p>This spherical room is clearly the head of the colossus. Two circular glass windows overlook the ocean to the south. Heavy silk curtains line the rest of the chamber. A beautiful woman wearing a platinum helmet lounges on a hammock next to three lifelike statues of a dwarf, an elf, and a gnome. A strange white orb swings gently on a bronze chain at the center of the room.</p>
<p>The eyes of the colossus are windows that allow light into this chamber. Behind the curtains, the walls of the room are full length bronze mirrors, a dozen in all. A single cord can be pulled to drop all of the silk curtains and reveal the mirrors. Finding the cord requires a successful DC 15 Investigation check.</p>
<p>The milky white orb that hangs from a bronze chain is the control mechanism for the colossus. Only someone in possession of King Acastus&#39;s @UUID[Item.3q3o19qelNnyJlrx]{rod of rulership} can activate the orb and take control of the colossus. To do this, one must touch the rod to the orb.</p>
<p>The woman on the hammock is <strong>Moxena</strong>, the <strong>Lady of Coins</strong>—and the leader of the Cult of the Snake.</p>

<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#moxena,-the-lady-of-coins]{Moxena, The Lady of Coins} (TN medusa) keeps her lair in the head of the <em>Colossus of Pythor</em>. Although few in the city know it, her true name is <strong>Moxena</strong>.</p>
<p>Moxena commands her forces from here, using the chamber as her personal quarters. She has set up a silk hammock on one side of the chamber. She wears a @UUID[Item.df73oZXzp6cuTyKJ]{ring of warmth}, which she expects her followers to kiss.</p>
<h2 id="statues-for-hexia">Statues for Hexia</h2>
<p>There are a three statues set up around the room—victims of petrification. The victims include a bard, (Xollos, an absent-minded CN dwarven @creature[Bard]), a poet (Sylla, a shy CG elven @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}) and a musician (Gondros, LN gnomish @UUID[Actor.Sbjw2JFBT5oXBTuj]{Commoner} who believes he is the greatest composer of this time, and probably ever).</p>
<p>Moxena intends to ship these entertainers to her mistress, Hexia, on the @UUID[.0000000000000009#island-of-the-dragon]{Island of the Dragon}. If the heroes are able to free the victims from petrification, they are immensely grateful and swear @reward[oath of service|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|oaths of service].</p>
<h2 id="battling-the-lady-of-coins">Battling the Lady of Coins</h2>
<p>In combat, Moxena will pull the cord that drops the curtains, revealing the circle of mirrors. She has trained herself to remain focused on one target, so that she doesn&#39;t see her own reflection. With the mirrors revealed, Moxena&#39;s <em>petrifying gaze</em> affects everyone in the room, except for targets who close their eyes. The party may be forced to fight with the &amp;Reference[condition=blinded] condition.</p>
<h2 id="an-unlikely-ally">An Unlikely Ally</h2>
<p>If Moxena senses that she has no chance of victory, then she will surrender to the heroes and propose a deal: she will join them on their quest. She has been using her thieves&#39; guild as a means to gather resources so that she can make war on her sister Thesilea, the Queen of the Amazons. She offers to show the heroes the way to Themis. There they may plunder the island for its many treasures, including the legendary sword @UUID[Item.GjZUXctedbq2YdBs]{Titansbane, Blade of Talieus} a powerful weapon that can be used against the Titans.</p>
<h2 id="moxenas-treasure">Moxena&#39;s Treasure</h2>
<p>There are two chests in the room. One chest contains Moxena&#39;s personal effects, which include three random @UUID[Item.u40N9h9Ub9BTWIEJ]{trinkets}. The other chest contains the money reserves collected by the thieves&#39; guild, which includes 55 pp, 450 gp, and 3,400 sp.</p>

<h1 id="the-great-games">The Great Games</h1>
<p>“_The Great Games have a history nearly as violent as the Aresian campaigns. It&#39;s just a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians tearing each other apart over the smallest dispute. Naturally, I&#39;m referring to the spectators, not the athletes._”</p>
<p>— Queen Vallus, on the Great Games</p>
<p>The Great Games are a series of athletic competitions between the kingdoms of Thylea. They began four centuries ago—a centennial celebration of the Oath of Peace and the end of the First War. While visiting Mytros, the party has the option to engage in the competition for a chance to win great fame and live up to their calling as the greatest warriors in Thylea.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-the-games">Purpose of the Games</h3>
<p>The Games are held every year to honor the Oath of Peace. Dozens of priests offer sacrifices to the Five Gods at the start of the games. The Order of Sydon have recently begun to participate in the Games also, bringing minotaur sacrifices for Sydon and Lutheria.</p>
<p>The Games are a political tool used by various factions to demonstrate their dominance. Because of this, the Games are officiated by a neutral party—Versi, the Oracle, whose judgment is respected by all.</p>
<p>Akimedes (TN mage), the Academy&#39;s arcane Master of Divination attends and watches over every competition to ensure that no one cheats. He wears special bronze goggles that grant him the effects of detect magic and precise vision out to 400 feet. Cheating is penalized by permanent expulsion from the Games.</p>
<h3 id="rewards-for-the-games">Rewards for the Games</h3>
<p>The victors of the Game&#39;s events are awarded special medals that are crafted from precious metals. These medals hold enormous value to collectors, but selling them is frowned upon. Nevertheless, many athletes are forced to sell their medals later in life, when they are past their physical prime and coin runs short.</p>
<p>Every event awards three medals—one for each of the top three athletes: bronze (250 gp) for third place, adamantine (500 gp) for second place, and mithral (1,000 gp) for first place. Legend has it that the Five Gods competed in the first Great Games, and &quot;good old Pythor won every single medal.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-competition">Joining the Competition</h2>
<p>p112</p>
<p>Before you, Mount Volkan&#39;s wide basin has been transformed into a grand stadium. Dozens of running tracks and courts have been set up for a wide variety of events. Rows of stone benches have been hewed into the mountainside, seating throngs of onlookers. Thunderous chanting, cheers, and celebratory music echo through the stadium. Both the athletes and the spectators hail from across Thylea, and they wear all sorts of exotic armor and colorful clothing.</p>
<p>The heroes can enter and compete in the Games, but first they must pass a trial. Entering a trial costs a single silver piece. The hero must win the trial in order to compete in the official event.</p>
<h2 id="the-athletes">The Athletes</h2>
<p>Every settlement in Thylea sends its best athletes to compete in the Great Games. Competing this year are the following athletes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cy</strong> (LN @UUID[Actor.LNtx0Vce4zjNYB9G]{Warrior Monk}) from the kingdom of Aresia. He is famed across Thylea for his accomplishments in previous Games. The citizens of Mytros hate him.</li>
<li><strong>Egan</strong> (LG @UUID[Actor.cW1mOTLOpYhPEfn0]{Veteran}) representing Estoria. He is an older competitor with more than a dozen Games under his widening belt.</li>
<li><strong>Falana</strong> (CG @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{Noble}) is a glamorous bard from Estoria. She brings a legion of adoring teenaged fans from the outlying settlements who cheer themselves hoarse.</li>
<li><strong>Hatria</strong> (CE @UUID[Actor.lpFwFXc1dnWn5E8n]{Amazon Warrior}) is a warrior and the first ever Amazon to compete in any Games. She is aloof and treated coldly by the other competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Jorges</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain}) of the Order of Sydon. He is arrogant and pompous and has an intense dislike for the heroes, particularly those who join the Games.</li>
<li><strong>Leyland</strong> (CG @UUID[Actor.WKlDH3u8kCxF5quF]{Gladiator}) represents Mytros and is a favorite of the home crowd. He is considered one of the greatest athletes of this generation.</li>
<li><strong>Pancras</strong> (CG @UUID[Actor.pXd2Yp0k9e0h8bJm]{Oread}) is a nymph from the distant northern steppes. He is quite an exotic figure, and is treated with curiosity by the other athletes.</li>
<li><strong>Spira</strong> (NG @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{Soldier}) is an underdog who suffered an injury five years ago and is only now recovered enough to participate. The crowd loves her. She has a Strength score of 16 (+3) and Athletics of +5.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="daily-sacrifice">Daily Sacrifice</h2>
<p>At the start of each day, animal sacrifices are made to each of the gods. These are carried out with solemnity, after requesting a moment of silence from spectators.</p>
<p>Minotaur Battle.</p>
<p>Recently, the Order of Sydon has started a new tradition: a battle to the death against a minotaur. This sacrifice to the Titans requires five athletes to work together to take down one @UUID[Actor.yJHY5rRaRPQ54HOn]{Minotaur}.</p>
<p>If one of the heroes wants to be involved in a sacrificial event, they can volunteer. If a hero volunteers to fight alone against the minotaur, then the other athletes will step aside. Besting a minotaur in single combat brings great honor and attracts crowds of onlookers, but there is no reward for winning other than the fame (and the pointed disapproval of Queen Vallus).</p>
<h2 id="optional-event-bullbug-1">Optional Event: Bullbug</h2>
<p>If you want, you can replace the minotaur with @UUID[Actor.JUsnO4SMbwwEYuVA]{Bullbug} (NG @UUID[Actor.P1kQCEodGIdtHop1]{Minotaur Hero}) from the <em>Minotaur Market</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#m21.-the-minotaur-market]{M21}). Bullbug calls out a challenge to the heroes to fight him. If one of the heroes can beat him in good-natured single combat, he will agree to join their crew. While this is highly unusual, Queen Vallus will overrule the protests of the Order of Sydon.</p>
<h2 id="daily-competitions">Daily Competitions</h2>
<p>These are the competitions that make up the Great Games. One competition is held each day, over a series of seven days, with celebrations every night.</p>
<h3 id="partners">Partners</h3>
<p>Each contestant can choose a partner to magically augment them. This partner is allowed to use any magic available to them. Most of the lesser athletes can&#39;t afford magical aid. Those who can afford it are aided by an @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{Acolyte} (who provides the @UUID[Item.J9cyYpoj85HULHak]{bless} spell).</p>
<p>Well-known athletes have access to a mage or priest. These spell casters prepare spells such as @UUID[Item.J9cyYpoj85HULHak]{bless}, @UUID[Item.LMCWcb7N5AR5watf]{enhance ability}, @UUID[Item.9G7l5V8Tvd8Eh2Ln]{longstrider}, or @UUID[Item.WNNH69V5hP3HIxqF]{haste}. Partners who target anyone but their chosen athlete are immediately disqualified, as is the athlete that they were aiding.</p>
<h4 id="magic-in-the-great-games">Magic in the Great Games</h4>
<p>p113</p>
<p>Thyleans decided long ago that trying to stop magic manipulation in the Great Games was pointless, hence the ruling allowing a magical partner to augment an athlete. It also allows heroes that aren&#39;t directly involved in a competition to be part of the action.</p>
<h3 id="jumping">Jumping</h3>
<p>A hero must first succeed in a trial jumping event against four other competitors (LN @UUID[Actor.k9HdrbhMqCYwqdJG]{guards}). Only one of the other competitors will try and jump farther than the standard jump.</p>
<p>In the actual jumping competition, the heroes will have to compete against Spira, Leyland, Hatria and Egan. A competitor can choose to perform a standard jump, which will result in a long jump that is equivalent to the Strength score of the competitor.</p>
<p>However, a competitor can also try to go further than the standard jump. This requires a DC 15 Athletics check. Failure means that the competitor lands 1-4 (1d4) ft. short of the standard jump distance. A success adds 1 ft., with an additional 1 ft. for every 3 points rolled above 15 (e.g. DC 18, DC 21, etc). Refer to <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/https://5e.tools/book.html#phb,8,jumping,0">page 182</a> of the 5th Edition <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#PHB">Player&#39;s Book</a> for rules on long jumping.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<p>To qualify for this event, a hero must first succeed in a trial event against four other competitors (two LN @UUID[Actor.k9HdrbhMqCYwqdJG]{guards} and two CG @UUID[Actor.sqDPcNmBZLfqzIOi]{scouts}).</p>
<p>Competitors.</p>
<p>In the actual event, the heroes compete against Spira, Leyland, Hatria, and Pancras.</p>
<p>This is a 1000 ft. run divided into six race stages. All of the runners must roll for initiative at the start. Whoever wins initiative gains advantage on the first check to move into the &#39;ahead&#39; state. This starting advantage lasts for the first three stages of the race.</p>
<p>Pulling Ahead.</p>
<p>At each stage of the race, each racer may choose to pull <strong>ahead</strong>. To pull <strong>ahead</strong> a runner must make a successful DC 15 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. This DC increases by 1 at each subsequent stage (e.g. DC 16, DC 17, etc). Failure means the runner gets one level of &amp;Reference[condition=exhaustion]. A successful check means that the runner is now considered to be in the <strong>&#39;ahead&#39;</strong> state.</p>
<p>Once a runner has pulled <strong>ahead</strong> they must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of every stage. Failure means they gain one level of &amp;Reference[condition=exhaustion] and they are no longer considered <strong>&#39;ahead&#39;</strong>. When a runner has two levels of &amp;Reference[condition=exhaustion], they collapse and are disqualified from the race.</p>
<p>The Final Stage.</p>
<p>At the sixth and final stage of the race, every runner who is considered <strong>ahead</strong> has a chance for a medal. They all must make Athletics checks, with the highest check winning first place, and the next two taking second and third.</p>
<p>If there are not enough runners who are considered <strong>ahead</strong>, then after determining the finishing order with the <strong>ahead</strong> racers, repeat this with the rest of the runners except for those who have collapsed.</p>
<h3 id="javelin-throwing">Javelin Throwing</h3>
<p>To qualify for this event, a hero must first succeed in a trial event against three young men (LG @UUID[Actor.k9HdrbhMqCYwqdJG]{guards}) and one woman (CN @UUID[Actor.sqDPcNmBZLfqzIOi]{Scout}).</p>
<p>Competitors.</p>
<p>In the actual event, the heroes compete against Falana, Leyland, Hatria, and Pancras.</p>
<p>Each competitor makes three javelin throws, and their best throw determines how they place.</p>
<p>Calculating Throws.</p>
<p>With each throw, a competitor rolls d20 and adds their Athletics, Acrobatics, or Dexterity bonus (the competitor&#39;s choice). This bonus is multiplied by 3 and added to the base javelin range of 120 ft. For example, a competitor with Dexterity 14, Athletics +2, Acrobatics +5 rolls a 15 and chooses to add the +5 from Acrobatics for a total of 20. This total is multiplied by 3 to become 60 ft. which is added to the base javelin range of 120 ft. for a total of 180 ft.</p>
<h3 id="discus-throwing">Discus Throwing</h3>
<p>To qualify for this event, a hero must first succeed in a trial event against three young men (LG @UUID[Actor.k9HdrbhMqCYwqdJG]{guards}) and one woman (CN @UUID[Actor.sqDPcNmBZLfqzIOi]{Scout}).</p>
<p>In the actual competition, the heroes will compete against Falana, Leyland, Hatria, and Jorges.</p>
<p>Each competitor has three attempts at the discus throw. The mechanics work in the same fashion as the javelin throw, but the base range of the discus is 90 ft.</p>
<h3 id="wrestling">Wrestling</h3>
<p>This event uses the grappling rules described on <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/https://5e.tools/book.html#phb,9,grappling,0">page 195</a> of the 5th Edition <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#PHB">Player&#39;s Book</a>.</p>
<p>To qualify for this event, a hero must prove themselves against Crusher, a drunken @UUID[Actor.RnrJ5r3ITVfDYhbl]{Black Bear} who drinks large quantities of fermented honeywine before the match. Crusher is a crowd favorite.</p>
<p>In order to win this event, a hero must win two grapple attempts in a row. Roll for initiative at the start. The first successful attempt means getting a <strong>hold</strong>, while the second successful attempt means getting the <strong>pin</strong>.</p>
<p>Competitors.</p>
<p>In the main event, the hero must wrestle against Egan (for third place), then Cy (for second place), and finally Jorges (for first place).</p>
<h3 id="boxing">Boxing</h3>
<p>This event uses the unarmed combat rules described on <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/https://5e.tools/book.html#phb,9,melee%20attacks,0">page 195</a> of the 5th Edition <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#PHB">Player&#39;s Book</a>.</p>
<p>To qualify for this event, a hero must defeat Smasher, another black bear like the one from the wrestling event. Smasher is fitted with bronze-plated gloves.</p>
<p>Competitors.</p>
<p>In the main event, the hero must box against Spira (for third place), then Jorges (for second place) and finally Cy (for first place).</p>
<p><strong>Monk</strong> characters have an obvious advantage in this event. The first person to be rendered &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious] is the loser. Roll for initiative before each match.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-relay">The Great Relay</h2>
<p>The great relay is the prestige event of the Great Games. It requires teams of five to compete in a five-stage relay race. In order to compete in the Great Relay, an athlete must have placed in a previous event. Alternatively, they may be sponsored by another winning athlete.</p>
<h3 id="competing-teams">Competing Teams</h3>
<p>There are three teams; competing heroes are the fourth team. The named contestants anchor the fourth and fifth legs of the Great Relay. If the heroes are unable to assemble a full team, they can try to convince one of the other athletes to join them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mytros:</p>
<p>Spira, Leyland, and three soldiers</p>
</li>
<li><p>Estoria:</p>
<p>Egan, Felana, and three scouts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Aresia:</p>
<p>Jorges, Hatria, and three thugs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parts-of-the-race">Parts of the Race</h3>
<p>Each member of the team must be assigned to run a leg of the relay. Once selected, they must stand at the starting point of that relay. They are not allowed to start running their leg of the relay until they are tagged by the team member from the previous leg.</p>
<p>Winning Points.</p>
<p>At the start of each leg of the race, the athlete can choose to go at <strong>standard</strong> speed or <strong>fast</strong>. Going at standard speed earns 1 point, while going fast earns 2 points. Failing a required check for the leg at either speed results in 0 points, though the athlete still finishes the leg. These points will be totaled at the end of the relay to determine the winning team.</p>
<p>If any single athlete is caught or reduced to 0 hit points by one of the obstacles along the way, then that team loses the entire race.</p>
<h3 id="first-leg-the-beach-run">First Leg: The Beach Run</h3>
<p>The athlete must make a dash over 300 ft. of sand. A standard run requires a successful DC 10 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, while a fast sprint requires DC 15.</p>
<p>Lions.</p>
<p>Partway down the beach, trap-doors burst open (one for each team) spraying sand everywhere and releasing a muzzled @UUID[Actor.fb80kDIqgON3qg9E]{Lion}. Each lion goes for one of the sprinters and uses its <em>pounce</em> action. An athlete knocked &amp;Reference[condition=prone] by the lion is out of the race. Lions have disadvantage on attacks against athletes who are going <strong>fast</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="second-leg-the-underwater-swim">Second Leg: The Underwater Swim</h3>
<p>Magic has been used to freeze over one of the mountain lakes. Each athlete must dive into a hole in the ice, swim underwater for 300 ft., and then resurface. A <strong>standard</strong> swim requires a successful DC 12 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, while a <strong>fast</strong> swim requires DC 18. Anyone with swim speed on their character sheet gets advantage on this roll.</p>
<h3 id="third-leg-the-cliff-climb">Third Leg: The Cliff Climb</h3>
<p>Each athlete must climb up a sheer cliff face. A <strong>standard</strong> climb requires a successful DC 12 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, while a <strong>fast</strong> climb requires DC 18. Anyone with a climb speed on their character sheet gets advantage on this roll.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-leg-the-fire-dash">Fourth Leg: The Fire Dash</h3>
<p>The athlete must sprint across a bed of hot coals and @UUID[Actor.Z5odsnCD7D4AvVdq]{fire snakes}. A <strong>standard</strong> run requires a successful DC 10 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, while a <strong>fast</strong> sprint requires DC 15. A standard run causes 7 ([[/damage 2d6 type=fire]]) damage to the athlete, while a fast sprint causes no damage.</p>
<p>Anyone who fails either check takes 10 ([[/damage 3d6 type=fire]]) damage. There are six fire snakes amongst the coals, and two of them will attack any runner moving at <strong>standard</strong> speed. Only one fire snake will be provoked to attack by <strong>fast</strong> runners. Anyone who fails their checks provokes all six into attacking.</p>
<h3 id="fifth-leg-the-harpy-cages">Fifth Leg: The Harpy Cages</h3>
<p>The athletes must race across 300 ft. of beach. Along the beach are three bronze cages, each with a @creature[Harpy|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords]. A <strong>standard</strong> run requires a successful DC 10 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, while a <strong>fast</strong> sprint requires DC 15.</p>
<p>Harpy Songs.</p>
<p>Each athlete must make three DC 11 Wisdom saving throws to resist the songs of the three harpies. Athletes can choose to cover their ears with their hands, but this adds 2 to the DC of the running check. However, it gives them advantage on their Wisdom saving throw against being &amp;Reference[condition=charmed].</p>
<h3 id="ending-the-race">Ending the Race</h3>
<p>At the end of the race, the team with the most points wins. The crowd reacts with great enthusiasm when each team finishes the race.</p>
<h2 id="the-award-ceremony">The Award Ceremony</h2>
<p>p115</p>
<p>Suddenly, there is a thunder of noise from the stands as everyone leaps to their feet and points at the sky with excitement. Descending from the clouds is a huge silver dragon. On its back rides a crowned figure, cloaked in red. The spectators cheer in unison. &quot;It&#39;s King Acastus! King Acastus has come to honor the victors of the Great Games!&quot;</p>
<p>The silver dragon touches down at the center of the colosseum, and the king dismounts with a flourish, waving to the crowd with a broad smile. He carries several shiny medals in one hand, and a crown of laurels in the other. Approaching the row of victorious athletes, he mounts a small stone platform where he can address the thousands of people in the stands.</p>
<p>&quot;PEOPLE OF MYTROS! My dear people, has this not been the most exciting contest in living memory? I have always loved the Great Games, and it has been my pleasure to continue sponsoring them, even in these darkest of days. Indeed, I believe that even the gods themselves are watching, and smiling upon us! I offer my sincerest congratulations to these fine men and women—the greatest athletes in all of Thylea!&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd thunders their approval, and hundreds of flowers are cast into the arena at the king&#39;s feet.</p>
<p>King Acastus takes this opportunity to steal as much glory from the victors as he can. He is sensitive to what pleases the crowd, and the people of his city absolutely adore him. The king hands out the appropriate awards the victors. The greatest athlete is awarded the @UUID[Item.edTNLtNswExNSBR7]{crown of laurels}. There is no monetary reward for winning.</p>
<h3 id="treasure-1">Treasure</h3>
<p>The medals are cheaply-made, but they are prized by the people of Mytros and can easily be sold to merchants in <em>Stygian Row</em>. The first place medal is valued at 1,000 gp, the second place medal is valued at 500 gp, and the third place medal is valued at 250 gp.</p>
<h4 id="awarding-experience">Awarding Experience</h4>
<p>p115</p>
<p>You should award 300 XP for participation in each of the six lesser events. Participation in the Great Relay should be rewarded with 900 XP. Participation in every event is worth a total of 2,700 XP, which is enough to bring a fresh character up to level four. If the heroes are higher than sixth level, you may double these XP awards to make participation more attractive.</p>
<h2 id="tavern-sponsorships">Tavern Sponsorships</h2>
<p>If any of the heroes were victorious, then they are approached by two tavern owners from Mytros, Ambrosia from The Siren&#39;s Roost (M18) and Julius from The Satyr&#39;s Tail (M19). They hate each other, but both of them want a sponsorship deal with the winner of the Great Games. Such an individual would attract a great deal of business to their taverns. The heroes can choose the offer they like best, or they can try to persuade Julius and Ambrosia to enter a bidding war.</p>
<p>Julius initially offers 1,000 gp and free wine for life, although he can be persuaded to offer as much as 3,000 gp. Ambrosia offers 1,000 gp and a night of pleasure—on the house, naturally. She will go no higher than 2,000 gp, but she points out that Julius is a greedy fool, and associating with him will tarnish the heroes&#39; names.</p>

<p>“_There is much to be gained by winning the Great Games of Mytros. First, they were born out of training exercises devised by the Dragonlords, so they may help keep your wits and reflexes sharp. Second, they are immensely popular throughout Thylea, and the names of the victors will live on throughout history. Third, it is a chance to prove to yourself that you are ready for the trials that surely lie ahead._”</p>

<h1 id="the-ghost-ship-ultros">The Ghost Ship Ultros</h1>
<p>King Acastus has given the heroes a map to the <em>Ultros</em>, the legendary ship captained by his ancestor, Estor Arkelander. Acastus claims that his scouts have sighted the ship at the Dead Falls. In fact, he has long known the ship&#39;s location, because his ancestor&#39;s ghost haunts his dreams. Estor hopes to lure one of his mortal descendants to the <em>Ultros</em> so that he may possess a warrior&#39;s body and take vengeance upon the Titans.</p>
<p>p116</p>
<p>The time has come to complete the next of your Great Labors. King Acastus gave you a map to the last known whereabouts of the legendary Ultros, but its location seems ominous. The ship was last seen near the Dead Falls in the rocky wastelands of the eastern Heartlands.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve heard stories of the Ultros. It was captained by Estor Arkelander the Dragonlord, leader of a savage and bloodthirsty crew. He savaged the islands of Thylea, leaving slaughter in his wake. Sydon unleashed his full fury against the vessel, attempting to smash it with hundred-foot waves and drag it down to the bottom of the sea with terrifying whirlpools. But the magic of the Ultros was so powerful that even the Lord of Storms could not sink it.</p>
<p>The ship and its crew went missing several years after the end of the First War. You must find it and take command of it, for you cannot brave the waters of the Forgotten Sea without it.</p>
<h2 id="the-ghost-ships-crew">The Ghost Ship&#39;s Crew</h2>
<p>Estor Arkelander&#39;s ghost is captain of the <em>Ultros</em>. Seventy ghosts and specters are the crew under his command, all of them Estor&#39;s thanes. The specters are crewmen who have lost their sanity and been reduced to soulless undead shades with no personality or drive.</p>
<p>Estor has been waiting for a band of warriors to board his ship. He wants a new body, and possessing a great hero will do nicely. For years, he has tried to lure King Acastus to his ship, but his descendant is a cowardly disappointment. He knows that Acastus has sent the heroes in his place, and he plans to haunt their dreams to discover the worthiest amongst them. He will mark the worthiest hero as the warrior he intends to possess.</p>
<p>The <em>Ultros</em> is usually docked in an inlet near the Dead Falls. Rarely, it ventures northward along the River Lethe. The ghostly crew of the <em>Ultros</em> are deathly afraid of the horrors of the Nether Sea, but they are nevertheless drawn to the chasm at the Dead Falls. The necromantic energy from the Nether Sea makes them feel almost alive again.</p>
<h4 id="a-pristine-vessel">A Pristine Vessel</h4>
<p>p116</p>
<p>For a ghost ship, the Ultros is surprisingly well-maintained. The ghostly crew keep the ship in perfect condition and clean it every day, by order of the captain. Estor still takes pride in his ship. It is, perhaps, the only thing that he has ever truly loved.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="traveling-to-the-dead-falls">Traveling to the Dead Falls</h1>
<p>Traveling to the Dead Falls from Mytros or Estoria takes about two days and requires the party to wayfind through forests and rocky hills. You may choose to run 1-2 @UUID[RollTable.N6Iw2MNaGWIfoEYY]{random land encounters} along the way.</p>
<h2 id="return-to-the-sour-vintage">Return to The Sour Vintage</h2>
<p>Located about halfway to the Dead Falls, the <em>Sour Vintage</em> tavern makes a convenient place to stop for a rest. Aetala now advertises the tavern as the place where the &quot;Heroes of the Prophecy&quot;gathered before slaying the Great Boar. She cheerfully offers the party free accommodations, and her patrons ensure that the heroes drink for free.</p>
<h3 id="rumors-of-the-ultros">Rumors of the Ultros</h3>
<p>Everyone knows of the <em>Ultros</em>. It&#39;s Estor Arkelander&#39;s ship from the legendary adventures of the Dragonlords! Several fishermen claim to have seen the ship sailing down the River Lethe at midnight, but no one believes them. Why would a ghost ship be sailing on a landlocked river?</p>
<h3 id="rumors-of-the-dead-falls">Rumors of the Dead Falls</h3>
<p>The patrons of the <em>Sour Vintage</em> know a few tales of Dead Falls. They say it&#39;s one of the pathways to the Underworld, the domain of Lutheria, Lady of Dreams. Strange things happen there. People say the rocks scream like harpies, and those who venture to the river&#39;s end never return. But there is an oft-repeated mantra that the patrons use to reassure the party:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Heroes have no fear of the dead!&quot;</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-falls-of-the-underworld">The Falls of the Underworld</h1>
<p>The king&#39;s map points to a secret inlet at Dead Falls, located just before the River Lethe rushes into a huge chasm. The <em>Ultros</em> is supposedly docked at this inlet every night in the hours before dawn. Getting to the ship&#39;s mooring requires walking along the river&#39;s rapids and passing through a narrow canyon. The heroes should arrive at midnight.</p>
<h2 id="the-rapids">The Rapids</h2>
<p>p117</p>
<p>The River Lethe descends further and faster and breaks up into frothing rapids. The water flows and gurgles at a treacherous speed. Large, sharp rocks jut from the water, making the river even more perilous.</p>
<p>The rapids are too dangerous to travel by boat or to swim. If someone tries to swim across, they must make a successful DC 20 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check every round or be swept away and over the falls. A path leads along the edge of the rapids: it is soaking wet but otherwise safe to travel.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-the-gates-of-death">Encounter: The Gates of Death</h3>
<p>p117</p>
<p>The path along the rapids twists and turns, and the sides of the canyon seem to be closing in around you. The walls are adorned with horrific carvings of what seem to be faces, both human and inhuman.</p>
<p>The path leads to a section of the rapids at the canyon&#39;s narrowest point, with only 20 ft. between the cliff faces. Each wall at first appears to be carved with horrifying faces, but upon closer examination, it seems that they might actually be mundane rock formations.</p>
<p>p117</p>
<p>As you make your way further down the path, the canyon continues to grow narrower. Cold winds assail you, howling through the canyon with a blood-curdling sound like an inhuman scream.</p>
<p>A passive Perception score of 12 or higher reveals that the cliffs are moving together, and that the wailing seems to be coming from the mouths of the faces. Heroes who notice this have one round to react.</p>
<p>On the next round, it becomes obvious that the cliffs are moving. The cliff path pushes up against the other side of the canyon, and the water beneath vanishes under the rocks. Anyone still on the path at this time must move 80 ft. to get to safety. Failure to escape means that they will become stuck between the rocks.</p>
<p>Escaping.</p>
<p>A successful DC 15 Strength (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check allows a stuck hero to squeeze through to safety. Failure means that they take 20 ([[/damage 6d6 type=bludgeoning]]) damage. Every round after that, they can make another check to escape. The damage increases by 20 ([[/damage 6d6]]) on each subsequent round. Anyone reduced to 0 hit points is instantly killed, and reduced to a meaty paste.</p>
<p>After five rounds, the cliffs return to their original position with the gore of any unfortunate victims plastered across the cliff walls.</p>
<h2 id="the-dead-falls">The Dead Falls</h2>
<p>p117</p>
<p>As the rapids twist and turn, you approach what appears to be a massive waterfall. The water of the river pours into a vast, shadowy chasm and vanishes. The sight is beautiful, but you find it disconcerting that such a large river could come to such a sudden end. The thundering sound that typically accompanies waterfalls is strangely absent here. It&#39;s as if the water and the noise have been swallowed by a void.</p>
<p>Here the River Lethe pours into a chasm, creating a waterfall that plunges for more than one vertical mile into the Underworld, which explains the strange lack of sound. Anyone who spills over the edge will fall for 20 seconds before colliding with the primordial waters of the Nether Sea, suffering 70 ([[/damage 20d6 type=bludgeoning]]) damage.</p>
<p>The secret inlet is shown on the king&#39;s map, but its location is not obvious at first glance. With some trivial investigation, the heroes will discover a switchback rocky passage that leads to the inlet. The passage is flooded by water (5 ft. deep), which the heroes must wade or swim through.</p>
<h3 id="investigation-the-secret-inlet">Investigation: The Secret Inlet</h3>
<p>p118</p>
<p>You discover an inlet near the chasm where the river&#39;s waters are eerily still. The canyon walls surround a small lake, protecting it from the rush of the nearby rapids. Moonlight shines down through the clouds, illuminating a beautiful ship moored alongside the rocky shore.</p>
<p>This ship is large, and of fine workmanship, though its design is ancient. Its sails are black, and the prow is carved into the likeness of a dragon. You see no crew aboard and you hear only silence.</p>
<p>The <em>Ultros</em> is anchored in this lake, but it&#39;s impossible to see how it got here. It is impossible for it to fit through the passage that the party used. The heroes may freely walk along the rocky shore to the ship and board it. Nothing stands in their way.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="key-locations-1">Key Locations</h1>
<h2 id="u1-the-top-deck">U1. The Top Deck</h2>
<p>p118</p>
<p>On the top deck of the ship, you feel a chill in the air. The ship appears abandoned, though it is well maintained. Listening carefully, you hear faint whispering and then sense movement around you as though from crewmen at work. For a moment, you think you can hear boisterous singing from the back of the ship but, when you turn to look, there is nothing.</p>
<h4 id="visions-of-the-ancient-past">Visions of the Ancient Past</h4>
<p>p118</p>
<p>During this adventure, the heroes will experience a strange dream during which the ship&#39;s ghostly crew become visible. Refer to the <em>During the Dream</em> sections of each ship area to determine who is present during the day or night in the dream. Refer to the <em>Before the Dream</em> sections when the heroes are first exploring the ship.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-dream">Before the Dream</h3>
<p>The top deck is empty. When anyone first boards the <em>Ultros</em>, they will notice the cold, and anyone staying on the top deck for more than a few minutes will begin to hear whispering. They will also see the ghostly crew members out of the corners of their eyes. As soon as anyone tries to focus on the sights and sounds, they will suddenly cease, only to resume a few minutes later.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-dream">During the Dream</h3>
<p>There are six @UUID[Actor.ByC6D019X45eZpRR]{specters} on the main deck, but they are not immediately hostile. They don&#39;t acknowledge the heroes in any way.</p>
<p>The Quartermaster.</p>
<p>At the steering wheel at the rear of the ship is the @UUID[Actor.Bw2DtApIfm2JEHf6]{Ghost} of the dwarf, <strong>Davos</strong>, one of Estor&#39;s thanes. He is singing a randy song to inspire the crew as they go about their tasks (the specters are not impressed). When he notices the heroes, he will end his song and call upon the crew to slay the intruders. The specters are hesitant to come to Davos&#39;s aid, with only one of them joining the battle each round. Once Davos is destroyed, the specters return to their duties. Davos starts off the battle by tearing the flesh from his face in order to use his <em>horrifying visage</em>. After that, he tries to possess one of the heroes.</p>
<h2 id="u2-storage-cabin">U2. Storage Cabin</h2>
<p>p118</p>
<p>This small storage cabin houses all of the necessary provisions for a short journey out to sea. There is an ancient chest in the corner. It appears to be locked.</p>
<p>This room is empty of crew at all times. There is no difference before or during the dream.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>There is a small locked iron box that can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using @UUID[Item.3uUg0fHZ48rdcNk8]{thieves&#39; tools}. Inside are six @UUID[Item.mOXPYkPXmsi8RTu0]{burnished dragonlord coins}, 75 sp, 35 gp, and a small leatherbound journal.</p>
<p>The journal gives a detailed account of Estor Arkelander&#39;s role in starting the First War 500 years ago.

<h2 id="u3-the-oar-deck">U3. The Oar Deck</h2>
<p>p118</p>
<p>The oar deck is clean, orderly and built to house 25 oars on each side of the ship. At each oar sits a single, silent man. Upon second glance, each of them appears to be translucent and partially decomposed.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-dream-1">Before the Dream</h3>
<p>A fully-crewed ship like the Ultros should have had 150 men. The remaining oarsmen are strong enough to man one oar each, which means that there are 56 specters on this deck. They have lost their sanity, and their souls have withered, so they are all silent and do not interact with anyone. If attacked, an oarsman specter will cower but will not actively defend itself or attack.</p>
<p>The Undead Drummer.</p>
<p>At the rear of the oar deck is an undead woman sitting by a drum. Her skin is white as bone and her eyes are missing. She has the statistics of a @UUID[Actor.XRK5RUAKawohEzVt]{Revenant}, but she does not have a focus for <em>vengeance</em>. She is not hostile, but she will defend herself if attacked. If destroyed, she will return within 24 hours, rising out of the river or the ocean to resume her place.</p>
<p>The drum-beater will ask one simple question in a whispering voice: &quot;Are you ready to travel to Mytros?&quot;She won&#39;t communicate in any other way. If the heroes say yes, she will begin to beat her drum. The specters will begin to row. Once this happens, read the following:</p>
<p>p121</p>
<p>The <em>Ultros</em> raises anchor and smoothly sets sail toward the canyon wall. The cliff looms closer and closer as the ship picks up speed, as if preparing to smash through the rocks. Just when it seems like the ship must collide with the wall, it suddenly dives underwater. The decks of the <em>Ultros</em> flood with water as it submerges, and you are forced to hold your breath.</p>
<p>The ship travels at a terrific speed, rushing past large aquatic creatures and shadowy rock formations. Your lungs ache with the effort of holding your breath but, finally, the ship surfaces. You find yourself surrounded on all sides by the gentle waters of the Cerulean Gulf.</p>
<p>The Dream Begins.</p>
<p>The ship now begins its journey to Mytros, but something strange is afoot. Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#visions-of-the-past]{Visions of the Past} section below to determine what happens next.</p>
<h2 id="u4-the-captains-cabin">U4. The Captain&#39;s Cabin</h2>
<p>p121</p>
<p>This cabin is more luxurious than the rest of the ship. The bedding is made of finely-spun silk, as are the curtains at the window. The wallpaper is textured with gold filigree. The wooden floor and furniture has been recently cleaned and waxed, and the room has a fresh, clean smell. There is a desk at the rear of the room with scattered papers and a journal.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-dream-2">Before the Dream</h3>
<p>The leatherbound journal contains several entries. It is written in the hand of Estor Arkelander, and it recounts the history of the Ultros. Refer to @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000025#the-curse-of-estor-arkelander]{The Curse of Estor Arkelander} in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000025]{Secrets and Myths} appendix.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-dream-1">During the Dream</h3>
<p>The First Mate.</p>
<p>In this cabin is the @UUID[Actor.Bw2DtApIfm2JEHf6]{Ghost} of one of Estor&#39;s thanes, <strong>Skathon</strong>. Skathon is deep in the ethereal plane most of the time. Anyone who enters the room feels cold and is assaulted by strange feelings of anger and guilt. Skathon appears before them, still in the border ethereal (and thus immune to attack).</p>
<p>Read the following.</p>
<p>p121</p>
<p>A ghostly figure rises out of the floor and speaks: &quot;Estor sends you to destroy me. You are fools to trust him!&quot;The ghost calls for his sword and armor: &quot;Ebony, Azurescale—arise and slay these intruders!&quot;</p>
<p>Skathon was a powerful warrior in life. He possessed a set of magical scale mail and a magical sword. These items hang on the wall at the back of the cabin. The sword will rise into the air and attack as an @creature[Animated Sword|MM], while the armor will attack as @UUID[Actor.MZ0RH8dl6dYVihZZ]{Animated Armor}. Once the fight has started, Skathon will leave the ethereal plane and try to possess a hero.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>Azurescale is a set of scale mail @UUID[Item.hMhURo3mzrMFILfb]{mariner&#39;s armor}, and Ebony is a @item[+1 mithral makhaira|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords].</p>
<h2 id="u5-the-thanes-quarters">U5. The Thanes&#39; Quarters</h2>
<p>p121</p>
<p>You enter a large room with six hammocks gently swaying with the ship. The room is otherwise bare, but there is a strange, ornate box sitting in one corner.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-dream-3">Before the Dream</h3>
<p>The ornate box is attached to the floor and secured with an @UUID[Item.VZ5UoNaG2qJdUM5O]{arcane lock}. It can be opened with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using @UUID[Item.3uUg0fHZ48rdcNk8]{thieves&#39; tools}. If the arcane lock is dispelled or suppressed with a @UUID[Item.Y54Crh3fGtxLwjry]{knock} spell, then the DC is lowered to 15.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>Inside the box are 16 onyx gemstones. If the gems are removed from the box, each transforms into a @UUID[Actor.ByC6D019X45eZpRR]{Specter} after one round (see the <em>During the Dream</em> section below for more details). The specters immediately attack the hero who took them from the box. The spectral onyxes have no value, as they are not true gems. Any specters killed before the dream will not be able to serve Metron later (see below).</p>
<h3 id="during-the-dream-2">During the Dream</h3>
<p>The Navigator.</p>
<p>The @UUID[Actor.Bw2DtApIfm2JEHf6]{Ghost} of <strong>Metron</strong> the thane is in here. One of the hammocks obviously sags more than the others when the heroes enter and then, a round later, Metron will fade into sight, though he will remain in the border of the ethereal plane. He claims to be from a lost undersea kingdom, but he&#39;s forgotten its name. He served as navigator aboard the <em>Ultros</em>, charting new paths across Thylea&#39;s oceans.</p>
<p>The Vengeful Spirits.</p>
<p>Metron will tell the heroes that the captain was a cruel man, one who was responsible for untold thousands of deaths. Many of those unfortunate souls have traveled from the underworld in search of vengeance, and Metron has sealed them away in a box. He asks if the heroes would be kind enough to help dispose of the troublesome spirits.</p>
<p>With a flick of his hand, the ornate box opens, and vengeful spirits swarm out of it over the next four rounds. Each spirit is a specter that attacks the heroes relentlessly. The horrifying forms that they take do not affect their statistics:</p>
<p>Specters in Metron&#39;s Box</p>
<p>Round</p>
<p>Number of Specters</p>
<p>Spectral Form</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Armless gygan warriors</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Eyeless Amazon warriors</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Headless centaurs</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Gutted minotaurs</p>
<p>If someone closes the box, then the specters will stop appearing. Once the box has been closed or the specters have been vanquished, Metron leaves the ethereal plane and attempts to possess one of the heroes. He prefers a hero with strong arms and legs for swimming.</p>
<h2 id="u6-the-storage-hold">U6. The Storage Hold</h2>
<p>p122</p>
<p>Stepping onto the hold, you&#39;re struck by the number of empty crates and boxes strewn about. Clearly this deck once housed many stores for the ship.</p>
<p>The storage deck is accessible via a stairway that descends from the <em>Thanes&#39; Quarters</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000006#u5.-the-thanes-quarters]{U5}). The chests and crates here are remarkably well preserved and usable, but they are all empty.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="visions-of-the-past">Visions of the Past</h1>
<p>Once the heroes have spoken to the undead drummer on the oar deck of the <em>Ultros</em>, they will begin their journey across the Cerulean Gulf towards Mytros.</p>
<p>On the first night of this voyage, the party becomes trapped in a waking dream:</p>
<p>p122</p>
<p>You fall asleep to the gentle rocking of the ship and the sound of waves lapping against the hull. Your sleep takes you on a journey to a distant time, sailing on a distant sea. The sky above is strange and otherworldly.</p>
<p>You stand on the deck of the <em>Ultros</em>, surrounded by dozens of men and women with grim faces and ancient weapons. You are part of the ship&#39;s crew, and you know that you have served the captain in countless battles.</p>
<p>Standing at the prow of the ship is a tall man with long, gray dreadlocks. His engraved bronze pauldrons mark him as one of the legendary Dragonlords. This is Estor Arkelander. He calls his entire crew to the deck.</p>
<p>The <em>Ultros</em> is sailing on a strange expanse of foggy, gray ocean. All the doors on the ship are now unlocked, and all rooms and their contents can be searched. The ghost of Estor Arkelander now stands near the ship&#39;s mast, gazing out into the void. He has called upon the strange magic of the ship to create this dream.</p>
<p>p122</p>
<p>Estor speaks in a deep, rasping voice.</p>
<p>&quot;I have summoned you here for a grave purpose. Tomorrow I walk into the fires of Typhon and become like a god. Thenceforth I shall be immortal, perhaps even as powerful as Kentimane, the Hundred-Handed. But I shall no longer call myself captain of this ship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a great honor to fight alongside you in the war against the Gygans. We have toppled their wretched cities, and flooded the oceans with their blood. But now, it is time for me to choose a worthy successor: a new captain for the <em>Ultros</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will choose the new captain from among my loyal thanes. Each of you swore a blood oath to serve me. I call upon you to swear that same oath upon the <em>Ultros</em>. Only then will she follow your commands as she has done mine.&quot;</p>
<p>Estor identifies the heroes as his new thanes, and he asks each of them to swear the following oath.</p>
<p>p123</p>
<p>I swear upon my life&#39;s blood that I shall captain the <em>Ultros</em> with honor. Even should we sail into the maw of the Nether Sea, my fate shall be bound to hers.</p>
<p>Players may excuse themselves from consideration to be captain if they want to avoid swearing the oath. However, the <em>Ultros</em> will only heed the commands of heroes who have sworn the oath.</p>
<h2 id="quest-the-traitorous-thanes">Quest: The Traitorous Thanes</h2>
<p>After oaths are sworn, Estor announces that there are three traitors among his crew. He tasks the heroes with finding the traitorous ghosts and destroying them. He refuses to release the heroes from the dream until this has been accomplished. He explains that whoever performs most admirably will take his place as the new captain of the ship.</p>
<p>Estor&#39;s Deception.</p>
<p>Estor does not plan to relinquish control of the ship. Rather than choosing a successor, he hopes to possess the body of the hero who proves to be the strongest during the following trial.</p>
<h3 id="the-traitorous-thanes">The Traitorous Thanes</h3>
<p>Estor Arkelander was originally served by three traitorous thanes, Davos, Metron, and Skathon, and they now haunt the <em>Ultros</em> as ghosts. The three ghosts will appear in different sections of the <em>Ultros</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Davos, the Quartermaster.</p>
<p>He is a dwarven ghost who can be found on the top deck (@UUID[.0000000000000006#u1.-the-top-deck]{U1}).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Metron, the Navigator.</p>
<p>He is a lazy ghost who can be found in the thane&#39;s quarters (@UUID[.0000000000000006#u5.-the-thanes-quarters]{U5}).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Skathon, the First Mate.</p>
<p>He is a powerful warrior who can be found in the captain&#39;s cabin (@UUID[.0000000000000006#u4.-the-captains-cabin]{area U4}).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-traitors-are-destroyed">The Traitors are Destroyed</h3>
<p>When the ghost of the last traitorous thane has been destroyed, the fog surrounding the <em>Ultros</em> lifts, and the heroes awaken from the dream. Any heroes who were killed during the dream wake with two levels of &amp;Reference[condition=exhaustion], but they are otherwise fine.</p>
<p>The New Captain.</p>
<p>The ghost of Estor Arkelander awaits the heroes in the captain&#39;s quarters. He is now satisfied that the heroes are stronger than his previous thanes. He chooses the hero who performed most admirably during the trial and appoints them captain. If they refuse the bargain, he grumpily offers it to someone else.</p>
<p>p123</p>
<p>&quot;You have all proven yourselves worthy to command this ship. But one of you in particular has shown that you are worthy to be captain. I offer you the honor of being my successor. You will know power beyond anything you could possibly imagine. Do you accept?&quot;</p>
<p>Estor&#39;s curse prevents him from taking possession of a hero without their consent. This bargain is a trap and, if anyone accepts his offer, Estor immediately takes possession of that hero for the next hour.</p>
<h4 id="estors-bargain">Estor&#39;s Bargain</h4>
<p>p123</p>
<p>Accepting the bargain means that the hero&#39;s personality immediately changes: they become dangerously cruel and obsessed with achieving immortality, and their alignment shifts to neutral evil. Estor speaks constantly in their mind, always encouraging the pursuit of power at any cost. His goal is to wear down the hero&#39;s willpower so that he can eventually take permanent control. Once per day, Estor&#39;s spirit can take control of the hero for one round without a chance to save.</p>
<p>Eventually, Estor&#39;s control over the hero may become permanent (which forces the character to retire as an NPC), but this should only happen if the player&#39;s behavior has become too disruptive to the rest of the party.</p>
<p>If no one accepts Estor&#39;s bargain, then he is confined to the captain&#39;s quarters, and he becomes absolutely furious at the party. Anyone who swore the oath to the ship may command it. One hero should be elected or chosen to serve as the ship&#39;s captain.</p>

<h1 id="return-to-mytros">Return to Mytros</h1>
<p>The ship returns to Mytros, where the heroes are received by a crowd of onlookers. News of the arrival of the <em>Ultros</em> has spread through the city like wildfire. The king and queen have also come to meet the heroes.</p>
<p>p123</p>
<p>When you arrive back in Mytros, Queen Vallus is waiting for you at the docks, accompanied by her retinue. But before she can greet you, a silver dragon descends from the heavens toward the <em>Ultros</em>. It passes overhead and lands on the docks ahead. King Acastus slides off of the back of the dragon to stand gracefully beside it.</p>
<p>&quot;You are great warriors indeed, to have taken command of my ancestor&#39;s ship... but the <em>Ultros</em> is a relic from bygone days. To stand up to the power of the Titans, we will need dragons—not ancient ships.&quot;</p>
<p>King Acastus has come to upstage the party. He is secretly furious that the heroes were not killed by the ghost of his ancestor. He coldly congratulates them on their success and introduces his splendid dragon, Icarus. He emphasizes that the <em>Ultros</em> is an ancient relic—hardly as impressive as his dragons.</p>
<p>Queen Vallus brushes her husband aside and proclaims that the city of Mytros needs the heroes now more than ever. She frowns and wonders how the <em>Ultros</em> made it to Mytros with no crew. It appears that all of the specters that haunted the ship have vanished.</p>
