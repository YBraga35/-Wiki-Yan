            <p>A noble race that roams the great plains of the world, centaurs are both feared and respected by other intelligent creatures. Centaur legends claim that they are the offspring of a powerful god of war that came down to the mortal plane in the form of a stallion. They are proud of this divine heritage and demand that the proper respect be shown to them.</p>

            <p>Centaurs possess a humanoid torso with a horse's lower body. They are as varied in coloration and physical build as humans and horses. Their horse body can be chestnut brown, black as a nightmare, pure white as a unicorn, grey, and other colors between. They can be a single color, spotted, have white "socks,"or have hooves of different coloration. Their human bodies can be of any skin color from dark skinned to pale. Their human hair can be black, brown, blonde, or red—but it most often complements that of their horse body.</p>

            <p>Centaurs are a proud people. They view themselves as superior to all other races and demand respect and adulation. They can be vain about their appearance and are careful to be dignified and aloof in the presence of others. However, most centaurs are also fond of drink and once inebriated they can become loud, boorish, and dangerous.</p>

            <p>Centaurs are a tribal people. Centaurs are fiercely loyal to members of their tribe and will never leave one of their own behind. When they mate, they mate for life. If they join an adventuring group, they will often consider that group to be their current tribe and will be intensely loyal to their fellow heroes.</p>
            <p>They normally roam huge expanses of steppe land that they consider their domain. They don't build settlements in these lands, but they are protective of them. While centaurs can be herbivores, they prefer meat and enjoy hunting, but they will resort to gathering fruit, nuts, and other plants if an area has been overhunted. Travelers who are respectful of the plants and animals in tribal territory are left alone, but those who disrespect nature or try to build permanent settlements of any kind will become a target of the tribe's wrath.</p>

            <p>Centaurs are distrustful of the civilized races. In the First War that raged five centuries ago, thousands of centaurs were killed by the invading Dragonlords, and the centaurs have never forgotten or forgiven. The distrust is mutual, especially as centaur tribes are now flocking to the banner of Sydon and raiding outlying farms. Centaurs that enter a Thylean town or city will find that they are tolerated but kept under constant watch.</p>
            <p>The centaurs tend to worship the mother goddess, but they will sometimes offer prayers to one of the titans, Sydon or Lutheria. They never worship the Five.</p>

                <p>Thousands of years ago, a woman came to Thylea seeking her fortune. When the creatures of that land asked her from whence she came, she would only say, "I am from the land of the Gorgons."In those days, Thylea was rich in natural beauty but poor in wealth. But the woman would not be deterred.</p>
                <p>First, the woman searched the steppes and mountains, and she came to the centaurs, asking, "Where may I find gems and jewels to rival the stars?" The centaurs offered her a shank of lamb and said, "Why seek gems and jewels when the stars are free to everyone?" Disappointed, she cast away the food and left the centaurs to their star-gazing.</p>
                <p>Then the woman searched the forests, and she came to the satyrs, asking, "Where may I find rivers of gold and silver that flow like fountains?" The satyrs offered her a goblet of wine and said, "Gold and silver make a very poor feast. Wouldn't you rather join us for a song and a drink?" Disappointed again, the woman cast away the goblet and left the satyrs to their revelry.</p>
                <p>Now, the woman wandered high and low, seeking her fortune to no avail, and finally she came upon three women weaving at a loom. She said, "I wish for riches beyond the imagination of all the creatures that haunt this accursed land." The three women, who were the Fates, warned her. "Is this truly what you desire? You may have it, but the price will be high." And the woman answered, "When I am rich, I shall have no trouble paying any price." And the Fates said, "So be it."</p>
                <p>The woman's eyes suddenly gleamed like golden coins, and wherever she turned her gaze, creatures were turned to stone. "So that none may rob you of your treasure," said the Fates. The woman's hair grew long and sinuous, slithering and scaled like snakes. "So that always you will have the company of hearts as cold as your own." And finally, the woman's hands were filled with gems and coins that were beautiful beyond the reckoning of stars or songs. Her name was Medusa, and she was the namesake of her curse, which afflicts many such mortals with more ambition than sense.</p>

                <p>Medusae have typically made bargains with some sort of fiend or fiendish power, but in some cases, they are oathbreakers who have displeased the gods or the Fates. Either way, they have been afflicted with the @reward[curse of the medusa|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords] as punishment, and recovery from the curse is not possible without the use of powerful magic. In some cases, even the @UUID[Item.CrfqCBjK8JdTHLqD]{greater restoration} spell may not be enough to break the curse. But in many other cases, the medusa simply embraces the curse as part of her identity. Children born to medusae are also affected by the curse.</p>

                <p>Minotaurs are the descendants of an ancient tribe of humans who were cursed by the gods, transforming them into half-human, half-bull monstrosities. Although they are widely dismissed as unthinking brutes, they are in fact as diverse and as intelligent as any other race.</p>

                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="2044"><span class="entry-title-inner">Legend of the Minotaurs</span></h2>
                <p>Over a thousand years ago, a tribe of humans washed ashore in Thylea and came to live in the southern hills of the Aresian peninsula. Here, they laid foundations for a city and called it Minos. But not one man or woman among them had the strength to till the hard, rocky soil. As fate would have it, they discovered a magnificent bull that could pull a plow through any terrain for days without resting. Using the bull's great strength, they were able to produce bountiful crops with which to survive the first winter.</p>
                <p>Over time, the people of the tribe began to venerate the bull, crowning him as the god of the harvest. When Sydon learned of this, he was furious. He threw curses down upon the settlers and transformed them into bulls, in mockery of their insolence. Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again—but their faces had been forever changed by the curse.</p>
                <p>The people of the tribe came to be called <em>minotaurs</em>—the bulls of Minos—and they have never fully shed their bull-like demeanors. Some of them merely have horns and a snout-like nose, while others have the entire upper torso of a bull. Some continued to dwell in the labyrinth, while others left to explore the far reaches of Thylea. Over the centuries, they have come to view their own cursed existence as the will of the Fates.</p>

                <p>Minotaurs possess uncommon strength, making them excellent warriors. The curse infuses their bodies with the power of a bull at all times, and their muscles seldom relax, even when they are drunk or asleep. In battle, minotaurs sometimes lose control of their emotions and fly into a rage. When this happens, the curse takes over, transforming them back into a full-fledged bull for a short period of time.</p>

                <p>Minotaurs are widely shunned, because they are believed to be unthinking brutes who have been cursed by the gods. Most minotaurs gather together to form small farming or fishing communities, far from civilization. The only way that most minotaurs can find work in cities and villages is to swear oaths of service that effectively reduce them to the status of slaves. Many bear this humiliation with stoic grit, but others resort to banditry rather than submit to the unreasonable demands of cowardly superstition.</p>

            <p>Nymphs are fey spirits that manifest from the beauty of the elemental forces of creation. There are many kinds of nymphs—dryads of the forests, naiads of the rivers, oreads of the mountains, aurae of the night sky, and nereids of the sea. They have walked the earth for millennia, ever since the Great Mother awakened them from the trees, waters, rocks, and breezes.</p>
            <p>Nymphs are most at home in nature, but they have been known to disguise themselves and live amongst mortals, for they are desperately curious about the civilized world. In spite of this, they often have a difficult time comprehending the day-to-day struggle of civilized existence. Their charms are such that they may inadvertently seduce and domesticate mortal 'pets' who see to their every need, leaving them somewhat puzzled by the ugliness and hardship that seems to pervade cities.</p>

            <p>There was once a river running through the mountains. None can say which river or which mountains, for this was so long ago that the land has rolled and shifted so as to become unrecognizable in the time since. The mountains were blanketed in a soft powder of white snow, and as the snow melted, it crept along the ground and joined together into streams of water, which trickled along the rocks and formed a river. And the river coursed down through a forest, emptying into the ocean. So it went for eons.</p>
            <p>But then one day, the snow on the mountains had a thought. "Am I alike to the water in the streams?"And so also did the water in the river begin to wonder, "Am I alike to the roots of the trees?"They were curious, but it seemed that they would never know the answer, for just as the snow went to inspect the streams, it became the water, and just as the water went to inspect the trees, it became the roots. And so it went for eons.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the Great Mother herself became aware of these questions. Holding the world in her embrace, she felt the curiosity of the elements rippling and vibrating across its surface, anxious for answers. And so, she loosened her grip—just slightly. The rippling thoughts of the snow and the waters and the rocks and the trees took shape, and their shapes were beautiful, for they were curiosity made manifest. These were the first nymphs.</p>

            <p>Nymphs are famed for their feminine charms, but they are not exclusively female. Some are awakened from the elements with a mix of masculine and feminine features, and others are quintessential specimens of male splendor. As fey creatures, nymphs like little less than to be nailed down by the crude shackles of mortal language. They come in as many shapes and forms as the earth itself. The only physical trait that all of them have in common is an awe-inspiring beauty.</p>

            <p>Nymphs have an insatiable desire to learn as much as possible about both the natural and the civilized world. Because most have had eons to discover the splendor of nature, it is the civilized world that interests them the most. However, they are not usually very accustomed to mortal culture, and so they may think of men and women as interesting baubles to be collected and admired. Even civilized nymphs tend to cherish their friends and acquaintances as 'pets' to be manicured and proudly exhibited. They are not above bragging about their collection—or fighting with one another over their favorites.</p>

            <p>Satyrs don't have the same strained relationship with the civilized races of Thylea that the centaurs do. Satyrs can be found in many towns and villages throughout Thylea, as well as the great city of Mytros. They are attracted to the abundance of experiences that civilization provides: the food, the wine, and most especially the music.</p>
            <p>The civilized races of Thylea are suspicious of satyrs, for there are many stories of satyrs seducing and corrupting both the old and the young alike.</p>

            <p>Sirens are a race of winged, aquatic humanoids that typically dwell near rocky sea cliffs. They are famed for their beautiful voices, which they use to sing haunting lamentations, captivating listeners and transporting them to a bygone age. Sirens are rarely found very far inland. They prefer to remain near the coasts, as the gentle roar of the ocean waves calms their roiling emotions.</p>
            <p>Sirens typically experience fluctuating moods from one day to the next, ranging from extreme joy and hope for the future, to extreme sorrow and pessimism. No matter how a siren feels, she expresses her emotion through song. On good days, she may annoy her companions with chirpy melodies and vocal warm-ups as she glides around on outstretched wings. Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet.</p>

            <p>The sirens once lived on a great expanse of shoals in the Cerulean Gulf, where they built a city of brilliant white limestone. Its towering spires and pillars thrust out from the rocky waters, allowing the sirens to fly or swim as they pleased. They lived here in joy, singing praises to Sydon, who governed the oceans. Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. "Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine."</p>
            <p>When the sirens learned that Sydon was displeased, they were heartbroken. They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies—songs of repentance—which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. "Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs."</p>
            <p>This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten.</p>
            <p>Centuries passed in silence. Eventually, a new song began—an endless lamentation for the city that now sleeps on the ocean floor. When Lutheria learned that the city of the sirens had been destroyed, she laughed. She captured an entire flock of the pitiful creatures and gleefully cursed them, twisting them into something monstrous. These were the first harpies.</p>

            <p>Sirens are not amphibious, but they are well-adapted for living in and around water. They are thought to descend from an ancient Nereid who fell in love with an avian celestial. Iridescent scales cover many parts of their body, and their taloned hands and feet are excellent for fishing. They live in small flocks along the shores of the ocean. Siren artwork, poetry, and architecture emphasize their special relationship with both the clouds above and the sea below.</p>

            <p>Every siren is born with an abiding sense of sorrow that never fades—a soul-crushing grief caused by the loss of her ancestral home. From an early age, sirens learn to sing the ancient songs of their lost city, which evoke heart-wrenching memories of a time that will never come again. Anyone who hears a siren's song is immediately mesmerized by the overwhelming emotion conveyed by her beautiful voice. Some are moved to tears—others collapse into catatonia. The siren herself is not exempt from this—the moment she hears her own lamentations, she experiences an intense pang of loss.</p>

            <p>Sirens have broad, feathered wings growing out of their backs, which allow them to fly like birds. For this reason, sirens are often employed as messengers, tasked with conveying satchels of written letters from one city to another. However, a siren can only fly when her heart is filled with light. On such days, her songs are bright and joyful, no matter what manner of message she carries. Thus the saying, "A siren in good spirits may yet carry ill news."</p>
