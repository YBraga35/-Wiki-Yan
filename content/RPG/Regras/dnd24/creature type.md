## Creature Type

Every creature, including every player character, has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. These are the game's creature types:

- Elemental
- Monstrosity
- Beast
- Fey
- Ooze
- Celestial
- Fiend
- Plant
- Construct
- Giant
- Undead
- Dragon
- Humanoid

The types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.
