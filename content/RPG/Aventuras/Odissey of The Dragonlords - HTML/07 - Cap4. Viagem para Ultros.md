                    <p>King Acastus is mounted on the back of his silver dragon, watching you with narrowed eyes. "I wish you well on your journey. Take care that you do not invite new troubles upon my city."With that, the king spurs his dragon and flies away toward the palace.</p>
                    <p>Queen Vallus arrives in her chariot. She climbs down and glides toward you with divine poise, while her attendants run before her, laying several baskets at your feet.

                    <p>"Every island is attuned with a particular constellation in the night sky. By selecting a constellation on the device, you may chart a course to its associated island."</p>

            <p>Powerful ocean currents prevent ships from approaching the islands without knowing their exact whereabouts. This is why most merchant ships remain close to the coast.

                        <p>"At the dawn of time, the Titans created many birds and beasts to live in the lands of Thylea but all the waters of the oceans remained empty. Only the Great Bear swam in the rivers and lakes. The Mother Goddess came to her and said, 'Great Bear, you are the wisest of the land-walkers, so I will grant you a boon. I will fill the oceans with creatures, strange and colorful, and you will have dominion over them. Would this please you?'"</p>
                        <p>"The Great Bear was quiet for some time until the Goddess prompted her to speak. Finally, the Bear said, 'Mother Goddess, I am humbled by your generosity. The creatures you speak of sound marvelous, but I love the lands and rivers and lakes too much to leave them for the seas.'"</p>
                        <p>"The Mother Goddess understood. She smiled, and with a wave of her hands, all the rivers and lakes of Thylea were filled with glittering fish, so that the Great Bear would never want for food. To this day, she loves to swim the rivers, catching fish. But she has never touched the ocean."</p>

Blood was spilled, but none reveled in the slaughter of warfare as much as Estor Arkelander, who was the general of the Dragonlord armies. In one brutal battle, he wiped out every gygan warrior to the last."</p>
                        <p>"After the massacre, the children of the gygans prayed to Sydon and Lutheria for protection. Moved by their plight, the great Titans rallied the centaurs, the nymphs, all the native races. They attacked the settlements of the Dragonlords across the islands in retaliation for Estor Arkelander's crimes. The First War had begun."</p>

                        <p>"In the western sky at dusk you can see the Spear of Sydon. It reminds me of the tale of Galimus, a soldier who broke his oath to serve the King of Estoria."</p>
                        <p>"Galimus was a lazy, brutish coward who preyed upon the weak. Recognizing this, his officers banished him from the army. Bitter and resentful, Galimus prayed to Sydon. If the Lord of Storms would transform him into the greatest warrior in Thylea, then he would kill the very king that he had vowed to serve."</p>
                        <p>"In answer to his prayer, Galimus was transformed into a powerful minotaur. Reckless with power, he rampaged throughout the king's palace, trampling and killing all who crossed his path. Eventually the king rallied his men against the monster. They stabbed him a thousand times with their spears until he lay dead."</p>
                        <p>"Because of Galimus, the people of Estoria and Mytros regard minotaurs as untrustworthy brutes, even to this day—but Galimus was a monster long before he became a minotaur."</p>

He spent decades on his quest until, on one of his journeys, he met a beautiful sorceress."</p>
                        <p>"The sorceress made him an offer: marry her, and she would use her power to summon every book ever written onto the shelves of his library. The young man refused her. The journey to obtain knowledge, he said, was just as important as the knowledge itself."</p>
                        <p>"The sorceress revealed herself as Vallus. She placed her hands upon the priest's eyes, and forever afterwards, he could read books in every language—even those long forgotten. This was a most beautiful gift from the goddess to her most loyal servant."</p>

                        <p>"Look! The Blacksmith. It represents Volkan, the God of the Forge. See how the constellation is shaped like a hammer? There's a legend that tells of an old blacksmith who, in his prime, had been the master of his craft. In all his long years, he never found a worthy apprentice and, fearing all his knowledge and expertise would be lost, he prayed to Volkan for help."</p>
                        <p>"The God of the Forge took pity on the old man, and in his own forge he created a golem, a lifeless figure of iron that would follow the old smith's every command perfectly. Volkan then transferred the spirit of the smith into the empty golem, and whisked it away to his secret workshop beneath the mountains of Thylea."</p>
                        <p>"They say the old smith works there still, whistling and hammering away, joyfully crafting tributes to the Forge God, his skills untarnished by time."</p>

Once the Lord of Battle, Hergeron challenged Sydon, the Lord of Storms, to a duel. Sydon had stolen his power from their eldest brother Talieus, and Hergeron sought revenge."</p>
                        <p>"But though Hergeron was unmatched in strength and valor, he had no mind for strategy. He greatly underestimated his younger sibling's newfound strength, and Sydon dealt him a crushing defeat."</p>
                        <p>"As punishment for his failure, Hergeron was cast down and imprisoned in the foundations of Sydon's newly-erected stronghold—the Tower of Praxys. Hergeron carries the full weight of the tower on his shoulders, and he will continue to do so for all eternity."</p>

She sleepwalks through all the sky, harvesting the other stars one by one, in preparation for the Great Feast at the end of time."</p>
                        <p>"There have always been two kinds of sailors in Thylea. Some who grow old and wise, and some who sail toward the Dreamer. I would not advise going that way, unless we have no other choice."</p>
