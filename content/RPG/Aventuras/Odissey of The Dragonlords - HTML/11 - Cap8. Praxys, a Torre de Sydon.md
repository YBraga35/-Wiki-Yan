        <p>The tower of Praxys is the oldest and tallest structure in Thylea. It is one of the few remaining landmarks from the time when gods walked among mortals, and the dragons and giants fought for primacy. Praxys serves as the throne of Sydon, the Lord of Storms. He uses it as a guard tower to watch for incursions from the outer world. The Titan has modified and rebuilt the tower over many centuries, and thousands of cyclopes and gygan workers have died to fashion his "palace."</p>
        <p>Sydon is often found at Praxys, surrounded by his sons and daughters. Although Sydon and Lutheria have come to hate one another in recent centuries, the twins bore these young empyrean children together in anticipation of the end of the Oath of Peace. Sydon has trained them to reclaim the powers of the Five Gods.</p>

            <p>Traveling to <em>Praxys</em> should be an ordeal. If the party has not yet encountered @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#event:-sydons-fleet]{Sydon's Fleet}, then they should do so on the voyage here.

                <p>After days of sailing into the far reaches of the ocean, the weather turns rough. Powerful storm waves threaten to overturn your ship, rocking it from side to side, and a thick blanket of fog obscures the sea around you. The wreckage of broken ships drifts past your prow, and you begin to wonder whether you will share the fates of their unfortunate crews.</p>
                <p>Eventually, you notice a beam of light, which seems to sweep the surrounding seas from an immense height. Massive rocks emerge from the fog: the foundations of a gargantuan stone tower. Your ship suddenly feels very exposed—tiny and vulnerable next to the impossible size of the structure which now looms above you. This can only be the Tower of Sydon.</p>

            <p><em>Praxys</em> is a great tower of stone, which breaks upward through a headland of limestone. It is massive in size, beyond any human scale, towering more than 1,500 feet into the air. It was carved from a small mountain that rose out of the ocean. The tower is 200 feet across, and its interior is filled with vast empty spaces that serve as storage chambers and prisons. Only three floors are designed to be habitable by mortal creatures, and each of these floors have ceilings that are 30 ft. in height, in order to accommodate Titans and giants.</p>
            <p>Across many miles of ocean, Sydon's tower projects a piercing ray of silver light, which searches for trespassers. This light radiates from the heart of a star that Sydon has imprisoned at the pinnacle of the tower.</p>
            <p>A huge stone dock juts out to the south. It was built for ships manned by gygans or cyclopes, not for human vessels. The dock is protected by a dozen ballista crewed by @UUID[Actor.bK3oCr1I4IMrDbgP]{gygans}. Each gygan can load, aim and fire its ballista in a single round due to their size and six arms.</p>

                    <p>This massive stone tower must be at least 1,500 feet tall. There is a large stone dock on the south side of the tower, which appears to be incredibly ancient, possibly thousands of years old. It stands strong against the abuses of the waves and weather, and a foreboding air surrounds the place. Birds wheel around the heights of the tower but, as the scale of the place hits home, you realize that they are not seagulls. The "birds"are distant griffons, each the size of a horse. The massive double doors at the base of the tower appear nigh-impenetrable.</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">
                        <p></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The double adamantine doors are 40 ft. tall and cannot be damaged. They are barred from the other side. They can be forced open by characters with a combined Strength of 200 or more; no check is necessary if the group are strong enough, but no more than a dozen humans can attempt the task at once. If the heroes lack the combined strength, they will have to find another way in—through the flooded basement.</p>
                <p>The griffons flying around the tower nest in many places on ledges and in window openings. They are aggressive towards anyone who tries to approach the tower by air. Someone using flight will be swarmed by 7 ([[/r 2d6]]) @UUID[Actor.eT1Cfh1tG8RUhvaQ]{griffons}. In addition, the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011#s37.-the-fallen-star]{Fallen Star} (S37) illuminates any flying creatures trying to gain access. If the first group of griffons are defeated, the light summons another swarm after [[/r 2d6]] rounds.</p>

                <p>There are three obvious ways to gain entry to the tower.</p>

                    <ul class="rd__list">

                            <p><span class="entry-title-inner">The Front Gate.</span></p>
                            <p>A direct assault on the main dock and gate is probably the most difficult. The gygans fire their ballistae as soon as approaching ships come within range. Once the gygans are dealt with, the main doors must somehow be opened. A direct assault almost certainly puts the tower on alert status.</p>
                            <div class="rd__spc-inline-post">

                            <p>Approaching from the air is difficult due to the griffons. But if the heroes are able to make it past the griffons, then they will have easy access to areas S9 and S26. All other windows in the tower are permanent @UUID[Item.tHqtbUEXouGFQiHj]{walls of force}.</p>

                            <p>The easiest approach is underwater. Anyone sailing around the tower will notice pipes located just below the water level. These pipes are large enough for Medium-sized creatures to make their way into the tower. The pipes provide access to areas S5, S10, S19, and S22.</p>

                <p>There are many different methods to travel up and down within the tower. At its center is a spiral staircase that climbs from ground level all the way to the tower's summit. The staircase was built for giants, so a humansized creature will find the constant climbing rather exhausting. Some levels are connected by a cleverly constructed elevator that was built when Sydon still possessed the divine power of artifice.</p>

                <p>At any time, you may choose to have Sydon deploy a full detachment of his army from the Heavens down to the docks. Sydon has been sending his soldiers down each day to join his gathering war fleet. The full detachment consists of 240 gygans, 10 gygan heroes, 24 minotaurs, and 8 minotaur heroes—all armed for war.</p>
                <p>The detachment marches down the stairs, stopping at each level to rest and give prayer to Sydon. It takes four hours for them to reach the lowest level. They will only stop if they are directly attacked. Otherwise, they ignore what is happening on the levels—they know that Sydon and his children will deal with intruders.</p>
                <p>You can use this event to close off the main stairway in order to force the heroes to find another route to the upper levels.

            <p>A 20 ft. wide bridge leads to the central staircase that ascends all the way to the top level of the tower. The staircase was built for huge creatures, and even gygans treat the stairs as difficult terrain. Fifty feet below the bridge, the central shaft disappears beneath the water.

            <p>Six @UUID[Actor.bK3oCr1I4IMrDbgP]{gygans} and one @UUID[Actor.VvgXmCe9KebSZB2y]{gygan hero} guard the entrance chamber.

            <p>The water is home to a @UUID[Actor.Fiz8tP9tbJwhtWFR]{Giant Shark}. The gygans feed the shark once a day with a chum bucket (which may be a clue for the heroes that something lurks in the pool).

His legs are pinned to the floor by adamantine spikes that run from the floor to the ceiling. The empyrean is now completely insane, and this can only be cured by a @UUID[Item.PLsSJJ79HR2x0cRl]{wish} spell. He is also trapped by powerful magic, and only another @UUID[Item.PLsSJJ79HR2x0cRl]{wish} spell can free him.</p>
                <p>If the party speaks to him, Hergeron is almost entirely incomprehensible and obviously in great pain. However, it's clear that he's trying to communicate something of great importance to the party. Some of the intelligible phrases that he speaks are like riddles:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>If someone casts a 3rd level or higher healing spell on Hergeron, it will take away his pain and calm him for a few minutes. In this case, he is coherent enough to answer questions. He has a vast memory, and he knows much about what is happening in the tower. Asking him questions is equivalent to casting a @UUID[Item.uIO3YLI9MGcYnw9L]{commune} spell.</p>

                <p>If Garzoon is defeated, the myrmekes will immediately stop attacking and then ask the heroes to free their queen. They speak telepathically, but their minds are so alien that no other thoughts can be understood. The myrmekes will not aid the heroes in any way, even by giving out information about the tower, because they fear Sydon's potential retaliation on their queen.</p>

                        <p>A bell hangs down from a large hook and is obviously meant to be struck to start the chamber's movement. It is not, however, a mechanical device—it is actually powered by a flock of twelve @creature[Harpy|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|harpies]. They nest along the elevator shaft, and when the bell is wrung, they fly down and grab hooks in the top of the chamber. The harpies are strong enough to move the elevator upwards by one level, and then they must rest for 1 hour. The elevator descends via gravity, and its speed is slowed by a system of gears.</p>

The blemys are intelligent enough to turn their attacks on the party if they feel that their lives are in danger.</p>

                        <p>If the myrmekes queen is killed, then the rest of the myrmekes sink into a torpor and will not react to anything that happens around them, with two exceptions. Firstly, any hero who took part in killing the myrmekes queen will be marked by the scent of her death. Any myrmekes in the same area as a queenslayer will attempt to kill the offender, even at the cost of its own life. All other enemies will be ignored. Secondly, the myrmekes will still defend themselves if attacked.</p>

Opening the valves from within the room only requires someone to rotate a large bronze wheel beside each pipe.

The singing comes from a beautiful fey woman, who is perched on the bed, singing to a handsome giant who appears to be in a deep, restful sleep.</p>

                <p>This chamber is furnished for a giant-sized king. An @UUID[Actor.cNAqWP3eMpJ7aqbZ]{Aurae} nymph is singing softly while sitting on the edge of the bed. Talieus (NE @creature[Young Empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords]), one of Sydon's children, is asleep in the bed, having been relaxed by her beautiful voice. The nymph does not want to fight the heroes or awaken her companion. She is in love with Talieus and does not want to see him harmed. With a successful DC 16 Persuasion check, the nymph can be convinced to keep him fast asleep for the next 24 hours.</p>

                <p>Nephele is a clone from the flesh of the silver dragon Balmytria, but she has been corrupted by the Titans. Balmytria's soul never entered her flesh, and she never learned to speak. When she came of age, Sydon gave her a pair of bronze and copper dragons to mate with, and she produced a brood of evil metallic dragons for the Titan's kennel. Her children include Icarus and Argyn, who were gifts from Sydon to Gaius and Acastus.</p>
                <p>For most of her life, Nephele was free to roam the tower. But ten years ago, she grew bold and attempted to escape into the Forgotten Sea. Sydon prevented her, and she killed dozens of gygans in retaliation. As punishment, Sydon slaughtered her two mates and bound her here in chains. She nurses a powerful hatred for the Titan and craves vengeance above all else.</p>

The audience chamber is covered in a @UUID[Item.G0zUi1GQPtoJYGUh]{darkness} spell and a curtain as well (which blocks the view for those who can see through magical darkness). Inside the audience chamber is Sydon's son, <strong>Talieus</strong>, (CE @creature[Young Empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords]), and a half-dozen @UUID[Actor.FMq9A6i8LHZK9Qy9]{goatling tricksters}.</p>

The portcullis over the entrance is a ruse—it's only there for decoration.

The bronze dragon uses its <em>repulsion breath</em> to force victims into the pits. The copper dragon uses its <em>slowing breath</em> on creatures to make the iron balls more dangerous. Any creature &Reference[condition=paralyzed] by the silver dragon's breath attack can be pushed into a pit—or into the path of one of the rolling balls. Talieus and the chorus of goatlings laugh mercilessly during the fight, mocking the heroes whenever anything bad happens to them.</p>

He then proclaims that he will make the heroes suffer for killing his pets. He continues to make threats as he puts on the ornate armor hanging on the wall. This takes [[/r 1d6]] rounds, giving the heroes some time to recover from the dragon fight. When Talieus is ready, he pulls the lever that returns the room to its original state and turns off the @UUID[Item.tHqtbUEXouGFQiHj]{wall of force} that separates the arena from the viewing room. He fights to the death.</p>

            <p>The Throne level of Praxys is the dwelling place of Sydon, Lord of Storms. From this level he watches over faraway places and even other planes of existence using magical scrying pools, telescopes, and other instruments. The children of Sydon and Lutheria spend most of their time on this level, learning from Sydon and preparing to take on the mantles of godhood from the Five. The children are named after the brothers and sisters that Sydon and Lutheria betrayed millennia ago: <strong>Talieus</strong>, <strong>Hergeron</strong>, <strong>Chalcia</strong>, <strong>Goloron</strong> and <strong>Yala</strong>. All of their children are @creature[Young Empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|young empyreans].</p>
            <p>The whole level is also a museum and gallery. Sydon keeps trophies from his triumphs here—a measure of his vainglorious love for himself—and artifacts of great power. This self-aggrandizement continues with the many statues of Sydon, showing him in all kinds of flattering ways: as a warrior, a judge, a philosopher, a father, a king, a giver of wisdom, a singer of songs, and a mighty hunter. Beautiful murals depict the history of Sydon and Lutheria in the most flattering light possible. Sydon is a boastful creature who has no qualms celebrating his own greatness.</p>

                        <p>The heavy doors open into a treasure gallery. There are six pillars in the room, and each pillar supports a shimmering glass case. The items within the cases are: a black helmet, a huge dragon skull, an enormous ruby, an ancient scroll, a huge bronze gauntlet, and a sword and shield.</p>

                    <p>Sydon's greatest treasures are on display here, although the only creature normally allowed inside is the Titan himself. Each artifact rests inside a glass case on top of a marble pillar. There are no traps, tricks, or secrets here, because Sydon does not believe anyone could possibly reach them. Reaching the objects is as simple as opening each case, but you do not need to tell your players that—let them worry a little.</p>

                <p>At the very top of his tower, Sydon has imprisoned his most valued treasure—a star that fell from the heavens ages ago. The star is the source of the roving light at the peak of the tower. It radiates an intense heat, and anything coming within 10 feet of it will catch fire.</p>
                <p>Creatures that come too close take [[/damage 6d6 type=fire]] damage per round as long as they remain near.

                <p>The star is, like its companion on the Astral Plane, utterly alien and incomprehensible. It was bound to the tower by ancient magic.

                            <p>The heroes might be able to forge a pact with the Furies in @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011#s33.-the-room-of-far-sight]{The Room of Far Sight} (S33). Having done that, they could lure Sydon into that chamber and use the Orrery to gain an advantage. Sydon does not know that the Orrery has the power of @UUID[Item.LJEgS3L7NeJjKEGJ]{time stop}, and he will pursue heroes if they retreat here.</p>

                        <p>Sydon has no desire to fight to the death at this point. His fleet is already gathering for an attack on Mytros, and there is no reason for him to remain here bickering with mortals.</p>

In this case, Sydon orders his daughter to prove that she is worthy to be queen. Chalcia fights to the death.</p>

                        <p>With utter amazement, Sydon realizes he is dying. He cannot comprehend defeat. Rage overwhelms his features as life leaves his body. At the very last second, he screams, and his body is consumed by lightning as a massive storm rages overhead. When the lightning stops, the Titan's body is gone, leaving behind the scent of fresh rain, which blows away on the wind.</p>
