    <p><em>Odyssey of the Dragonlords</em> provides heroes with the means to become gods. Becoming a god requires the heroes to cast powerful spells, forge mighty artifacts, and perform great deeds. It is a very difficult process, but it's achievable for heroes who complete the epic adventures presented in this book.</p>
    <p>The Divine Path focuses entirely on the mechanisms required to become a god. Once a character becomes a god, it is assumed that their adventures have come to an end. True gods no longer live on the mortal planeâ€”they are occupied with divine responsibilities.</p>
    <p>The Divine Path is not for everyone. There are many heroes who would rather live out normal mortal lives. These heroes are content with their names being remembered for thousands of years. Don't force anyone to become a god unless it's clearly what they want.</p>

        <p>To start down the Divine Path, the heroes must first complete a ritual that involves three powerful artifacts:</p>
        <ul class="rd__list">
            <li class="rd__li ">The @UUID[Item.kuJGgGBuqPaPmrrv]{Caduceus}.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">The @UUID[Item.9qrdfpdKLI5XFTMy]{Ambrosia}.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">The @item[Promethean Fire|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These items are the components of a 9th level spell called @UUID[Item.NZoOm6LoxCd31nD7]{theogenesis} that is available to clerics, sorcerers, and wizards.</p>

        <p>A hero must meet the following requirements before being able to ascend to godhood:</p>
        <ul class="rd__list">
            <li class="rd__li ">Must be 20th level</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Must possess a divine spark</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Must have a Fame level of 20</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once all of these requirements are met, the hero must perform a legendary domain feat. These feats vary depending upon the chosen divine domain.</p>

        <p>When a hero completes his or her legendary domain feat, the hero becomes immortal and gains powers on a level similar to the Five Gods. The hero is essentially a demigod and can remain on the prime material plane.</p>
        <p>The hero is unable to grant spells to their followers until they ascend to true godhood. Meanwhile, the hero gains the following abilities:</p>

        <p>If the hero decides to ascend, they effectively leave the mortal plane and become bound to one of the divine planes of existence. Heroes may choose to delay their ascension for as long as they please. They might still have pressing business on the mortal plane.</p>

            <p>When a hero decides to ascend to godhood, they must retire their character. Gods have responsibilities to attend to which are beyond the scope of this book. However, they should become permanent fixtures of the Thylean pantheon, and future characters may choose them as a patron god or goddess.</p>
