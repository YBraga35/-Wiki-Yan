        <p>When the heroes left Mytros on their sea voyage, they had sixty days to confront the Titans and complete their quest. When this time expires, the peace that has reigned for five hundred years will come to an end, and the Titans will be free to make war upon all the mortals of Thylea. Sydon has spent centuries preparing his army for this occasion, and Lutheria gleefully anticipates harvesting the souls of the countless mortals who will die in the ensuing battle.</p>

            <p>Kyrah frequently reminds the party of the time they have remaining before the Oath of Peace ends. She serves as a grim harbinger of doom, counting down the number of days until the Titans unleash hell.</p>
            <p>On the 50th day of the voyage, Kyrah warns the party that they have only ten days remaining until the Oath of Peace comes to an end. She grows distant and agitated—concerned for the future. She strongly suggests that the party make haste to confront Sydon and Lutheria, or else make plans to return to Mytros. The city needs strong defenses against the coming storm, and she has no faith in King Acastus.</p>

                <p>As the sun dawns on the sixtieth day of your voyage, you realize that something has changed. A strange wind blows from the southeast, driving black storm clouds across the heavens, and the sky itself darkens to a menacing red. You feel deep within your bones that the Oath of Peace has come to an end. Now, it seems, the lands and seas and sky of Thylea are filled with anger.</p>
                <p>Kyrah and Pythor call you to the deck of the <em>Ultros</em>. They stand at the prow, gazing off towards the horizon, and their eyes shine like burnished gold.</p>
                <p>"The Oath has ended, and we are no longer gods."</p>

                <p>The two gods begin to change, slowly at first. Their skin changes, transforming into metallic scales, and great wings unfurl from their backs. Their faces transform into something draconic, as sharp teeth protrude from their mouths. They grow in size, becoming huge. The deck of the ship can no longer quite accommodate the bulk of their massive forms.</p>
                <p>Kyrah looms up as Pythor takes flight. Both are now bronze dragons, terrifying, magnificent and dangerous creatures. Somehow, you understand that they have always been dragons, but they were held in the guise of immortals for 500 years by the power of the Oath.</p>

            <p>Kyrah explains that long ago, she and her family were the dragon mounts of the Dragonlords. During the First War, her mother, Balmytria, tricked the Titans into surrendering much of their divine power. Consequently, Balmytria and her brood were transformed into the Five Gods. The full story is revealed in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000025#the-game-of-the-gods]{Game of the Gods} section of the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000025]{Secrets and Myths} appendix.</p>
            <p>Balmytria became known as Mytros, and she ascended to the outer planes as a true goddess. Kyrah, Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus remained behind to finish the First War. The armies of the Titans were destroyed, and the Dragonlords were killed. In the end, the new gods and the ancient Titans swore to the Oath of Peace.</p>

            <p>One of the conditions of the Oath of Peace was that the Five Gods would eventually surrender their power. Now, that time has come, and they are no longer gods.</p>
            <p>Kyrah, Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus are still capable of @UUID[Item.Vx5CqVLXOeZZQmdy]{polymorphing} into their mortal guises, but they no longer possess the divine powers that were stolen from the Titans.

                <p>From now on, Kyrah, Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus use the statistics of @UUID[Actor.MfpN9fc3T5QVcjeB]{young bronze dragons}, rather than their previous "immortal"statistics. Their personalities are the same, but they are no longer gods.

            <p>The heroes are now given an opportunity to bond with the four dragons. Each hero has an opportunity to choose which dragon they would prefer to bond with and, if the dragon agrees, the hero should follow the convention and tradition of Thylea by swearing the @reward[Oath of the Dragonlord|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords] which can be found in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000023]{Dragonlords} appendix.

                    <p>Depending on your heroes' abilities, and your own comfort in running two separate events at the same time, you may allow your players to split the party and tackle two conflicts at once. For example, half the party might take two dragons to confront Acastus (in @UUID[.0000000000000012#the-mad-king]{2. The Mad King} <em class="ve-muted">was originally The False Dragonlord</em>) while the other half of the party takes two dragons to confront Sydon (in @UUID[.0000000000000012#the-armies-of-sydon]{The Armies of Sydon}). Splitting the party like this counts as rescuing citizens in both conflicts; therefore the party should be rewarded with both of the associated blessings from Mytros.</p>

                <p>Towering over the city harbor is a gargantuan silver dragon. His roar thunders across the ocean, shaking your very bones and sending a chill down your spine. The dragon crushes several buildings beneath his massive claws and snaps his jaws at a crowd of fleeing citizens. Many are crushed by his fearsome jaws.</p>
                <p>Kyrah grits her teeth. "It is the king's dragon, Icarus. He has gone mad with power."</p>

            <p>As the heroes arrive in Mytros, the harbor is already under attack by an @UUID[Actor.Oxcf71xfY5KGaJif]{Ancient Silver Dragon}. Kyrah will recognize him as Icarus, the king's own dragon. Acastus has apparently fed him all the remaining doses of his @UUID[Item.IBy2D5CgWxHeMpZ2]{potion of aging}, presumably in the hope of protecting the city from the wrath of the Titans. Rather than protecting the city, the dragon has been driven mad by the cumulative effects of the potion—and his newfound power.</p>
            <p>Icarus will destroy the city unless he can be stopped. The heroes will stand a much better chance of surviving this encounter if they battle the gargantuan dragon while mounted on the backs of the four metallic dragons that they have recently bonded.</p>

                        <p>Icarus is not used to his size or his power, so he will stumble and misjudge his abilities during the fight. Every other round, he suffers from disadvantage, because his mind has not fully adjusted to his new size.

Icarus has the mind of a very young dragon, and he gives no thought to the citizens crushed beneath his claws or frozen by his breath attacks during the battle.

            <p>King Acastus, stricken by guilt and unable to bear watching his beloved city being destroyed, has retreated to the colosseum. There, he has been joined by his seven Dragonlord @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{captains}, including <strong>Tarchon</strong>. The captains are circling overhead, mounted on @UUID[Actor.QBpQf4GZ4nwwWBe1]{young copper dragons}. The king is pacing nervously at the center of the colosseum, next to his @UUID[Actor.AWJT0difI7p5hz2w]{Adult Copper Dragon} mount.</p>
            <p>The heroes can easily see the dragons circling above the colosseum from anywhere in the city. Volkan will mention that the @UUID[Item.3q3o19qelNnyJlrx]{rod of rulership} in the king's possession could be a powerful weapon against the Titans. He doesn't understand why the rod hasn't been used: Acastus knows how the rod works, but for some reason, the king hasn't used it to defend the city.</p>
            <p>When the heroes arrive at the colosseum, Acastus stops pacing and greets them coldly.</p>

Stupid, stupid beasts!"He kicks his mount viciously. "My ancestors were fools to fight against the power of the Titans. We should... we must... we have no choice but to bow to them! Perhaps then they will spare... some of us."</p>
                <p>The king watches you with a mad gleam in his eyes.</p>
                <p>"They will demand sacrifices. That is only fair. Fair recompense for the damage that you've done to them. But many such sacrifices must be made in the pursuit of greatness. Yes, I think they will spare me—and my city—if we offer them your heads."</p>

                    <p>The colossus takes one hesitant step from its platform, straightens itself, and then flexes its magical muscles. The citizens of besieged Mytros erupt into joyous cheers. "The colossus has awakened! The god of battle has come to save the city!"</p>

The Titan can be found at the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#m6-the-royal-gate]{Royal Gate} (M6), accompanied by two of his children (NE @creature[Young Empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|young empyreans]).

The walls of the palace compound are almost entirely ruined, having suffered repeated blows from the hammers wielded by Sydon's terrifying children. The Lord of Storms himself looms over the walls, loudly praising his children's work.</p>
                <p>As you approach, Sydon's keen eye catches sight of you. "Aha! The Heroes of the Prophecy. You have shown impressive valor for mortals, but the time has come to face the truth. You are outmatched!"</p>
                <p>"Look around you: the city of Mytros cannot withstand the power of the Titans. Kneel before me, and I shall endeavor to find a place for you as servants in my new kingdom. Otherwise, I can only promise you a warrior's death."</p>

                <p>Lutheria glides through the streets of Mytros, leaving chaos and debauchery in her wake. She cackles as she transforms citizens into goats, cows, and pigs.</p>
                <p>Those around her seem to go mad—falling into fits of hysterical laughter or engaging in unspeakable acts with whatever livestock happens to be nearby. Eventually, the Titan discovers you. Gazing down at you from her full height, she grins malevolently.</p>
                <p>"Have you come to join the Great Feast? I promise you'll not go hungry."She offers you a spit-roasted pig and smiles broadly. "Go on—eat, drink, be merry! What could you possibly stand to lose?"</p>

            <p>@UUID[Actor.1rqSlezWY78n7YzV]{Lutheria} has reduced about half of the surviving population of Mytros to a bestial state. They are either transformed into farm livestock, mindlessly engaging in profane revelry, or both. She shows no sign of stopping her nightmarish progress through the city.</p>
            <p>If the heroes fail to stop Lutheria, then the people of Mytros will begin the "Great Feast."They roast each other alive and devour their own families. Lutheria giggles and explains this to the heroes—it's the greatest practical joke in the history of Thylea! She repeatedly licks the spit-roasted pig and offers it to the heroes, struggling to contain her laughter.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Lutheria tires of telling her jokes. As long as the heroes engage her in worthwhile conversation, she holds her temper in check. Once she grows bored, her mood turns icy cold, and she attacks. She is immediately joined by an @UUID[Actor.cNAqWP3eMpJ7aqbZ]{Aurae} nymph and an @UUID[Actor.qM56z0Sgiy3t7U34]{Erinyes}. Lutheria and her servants fight to the death.</p>

            <p>If either Sydon or Lutheria has been killed, then @UUID[Actor.fbtYPqiLw63Nr3Ru]{Kentimane} of the Hundred Hands awakens to wreak vengeance upon the city. This battle should be incredibly difficult and may result in deaths among the heroes.</p>
            <p>If you want to be generous, you can let your heroes have a short rest before this battle begins to allow a limited time for recovery. The heroes will need to utilize the full power of both the dragons and the colossus, if possible. Kentimane specifically targets the heroes, which means that the heroes may choose to lure him away from the city and fight him at sea.</p>

                        <p>In the aftermath of the battle, the city falls into an unnatural silence. It seems for a moment that the danger has passed. But then, the earth starts shaking.</p>
                        <p>The effect is subtle at first: pebbles clattering on the pavement. The tremors continue every few seconds and slowly build into bone-rattling earthquakes—the echoes of gigantic footsteps. Suddenly, four tremendous arms emerge from behind Mount Volkan and grasp the summit, dragging behind them a gargantuan form. It's Kentimane, the Hundred Handed Titan!</p>
                        <p>Kentimane roars and assaults the city with brute force. The ancient titan is over 100 feet tall and every bit as terrifying as described in legends. Massive arms erupt from the ground, opening a path of death and destruction. Dozens of arms and small heads protrude from his body, hideous echoes of primordial chaos. He lumbers forward—directly toward <em>you</em>.</p>

            <p>You can use the accumulated dead from collateral damage to determine how the people of Mytros react to the battle in the following months. High numbers of casualties result in a long period of mourning, whereas low numbers of casualties result in great festivities. If the party sent the dragons to rescue citizens, then just subtract the number of rescued citizens from the final cumulative death toll. Mortals who have been transformed into beasts revert back after 8 hours.</p>

                <p>With the fall of Acastus, the city of Mytros has lost its king. The Titans have fallen, and the gods are no longer gods. It's time for a new order to reign in Thylea.</p>
                <p>The heroes should now be at an exceptional level of fame, with shrines or temples across the land venerating their names. The time has come for the heroes to ascend to their rightful place as the new rulers of Thylea.</p>
