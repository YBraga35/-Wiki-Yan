    <p>This appendix provides a variety of encounters that you can use on land or at sea during your campaign. Encounters can be used to provide extra combat challenges and atmosphere to journeys across Thylea.</p>
    <p>Some of these encounters need not end in bloodshed. They may be used to provide valuable information to the party or to guide them in the right direction on their quest. They can also be used for comic relief, when the party needs a reprieve from high stakes adventuring.</p>

        <p>Random encounters can be used to spice up a session during travel. Roll a d20 for each day of travel; on result of 11 or higher, the party encounters something. Roll d100 on the table below, using the appropriate environment. Alternatively, you may simply select something that suits the party's current situation:</p>

                            <p>A group of badly-wounded bandits are looking for help. They tried to waylay a band of centaurs, but the ambush went poorly. There are 7 ([[/r 2d6]]) @UUID[Actor.Bem18BiSuNBS60Zh]{bandits} and a @UUID[Actor.2WcCdN8Z0emHlTsK]{Bandit captain}. All have been reduced to half hit points. The bandit captain tries to convince the heroes to join forces with them before the centaur band arrives.</p>
                            <p>Five @UUID[Actor.U93UUfo9H42V9EXi]{centaurs} arrive 10 minutes later. If the bandits are alive when the centaurs appear, the heroes must make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the centaurs that they have nothing to do with the bandits.</p>
                            <p>If the bandits are dead, then the Persuasion check is only DC 10. If the heroes team up with the bandits to defeat the centaurs, the bandit captain rewards the heroes with 50 gp and a @UUID[Item.CiZBbo5EAjO7IxPK]{potion of healing}.</p>

The two got on very well for several months until the cyclops lost his temper and killed his new friend. Now he deeply regrets it. He notices the party immediately and vents his anger on them, believing that they will try to kill him, because he's "just a stupid monster."Unless the party can use @UUID[Item.AiaNjfEOt4cDRB9g]{raise dead} or some other spell to resurrect his friend, the blemys will attack the party and try to drive them away, weeping the whole time.</p>

A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check will convince her to leave the party alone. If she easily "smashes"the heroes (knocks down half their number), she will feel sorry for them.

A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check will convince her to leave the party alone. If she easily "smashes"the heroes (knocks down half their number), she will feel sorry for them. Such weaklings are not worth sacrificing, and she will spare them if they beg for their "little"lives.</p>

                            <p>Your ship sails into waters that are curiously transparent, and the white sand of the seabed is clearly visible. As you sail on, the sea grows shallower and you notice what appears to be a dense coral forest. However, a closer look reveals that the colorful forest below your keel is an undersea village of some kind. Merfolk wave up at your ship in welcome.</p>

                        <p>The merfolk are very curious about the party and their crew. Some of them swim to the surface to greet the party and invite them down into their village.</p>
                        <p>All of the merfolk have the <em>amphibious</em> trait and swim speed of 40 ft. A mermaid named <strong>Iolaah</strong> (CG merfolk @UUID[Actor.bwLvfvC1hzyUwujA]{Druid}) asks questions about the party's origins and purpose in this part of the ocean. If the heroes reveal their quest, Iolaah will become very interested and will want to take them to meet her father, Hywin.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hywin</strong> (NG merfolk @UUID[Actor.i7hNyi2lno1tHY2r]{Archmage}) resides in a beautiful translucent coral sphere. He is an enemy of Sydon, and he is willing to help anyone who opposes the Titan. He knows the entire history of Sydon and Lutheria and is willing to tell the tale. Afterwards, he breaks off a piece of coral for each character that has come to see him.</p>
                        <p>These simultaneously act as @UUID[Item.9xOdcWfCq8wqdFLx]{potions of water breathing} and @UUID[Item.g9R3J1se7jUnNl2o]{heroism} on anyone who swallows them. He wishes the party well on their quest.</p>
                        <p>Iolaah wishes to accompany the characters, but Hywin will forbid it. He tells the characters that Iolaah is impetuous and young and not ready for such an adventure. An hour after the ship sails away from the merfolk, a single dolphin swims alongside the ship. It transforms into Iolaah. She climbs aboard the ship and asks to accompany the heroes on their quest.</p>
                        <p>If the party refuses, she will be disappointed and she returns home safely. Otherwise, she joins the party on their quest. Iolaah is extraordinarily reckless in battle and unlikely to survive for very long. If she dies during the quest, Hywin will hold the party responsible. He may seek vengeance upon the heroes later.</p>

This central lump in the seabed is the nesting ground of a dreadful @UUID[Actor.ZunwFOwae2AlYxI4]{Hydra}. It eventually rises to the surface and attacks everyone who is on deck. This hydra is far bigger than most, with seven heads and maximum hit points. It can be distracted for 1 round by feeding it a sacrificial animal, but three full rounds are required to escape from the creature.</p>

                        <p>The hags @UUID[Item.Vx5CqVLXOeZZQmdy]{polymorph} their victims into crabs and stuff them into bags.

                            <p>Your ship sails into waters that are curiously transparent, and the white sand of the seabed is clearly visible. As you sail on, the sea grows shallower and you notice what appears to be a dense coral forest. However, a closer look reveals that the colorful forest below your keel is an undersea village of some kind. Merfolk wave up at your ship in welcome.</p>

                        <p>The merfolk are very curious about the party and their crew. Some of them swim to the surface to greet the party and invite them down into their village.</p>
                        <p>All of the merfolk have the <em>amphibious</em> trait and swim speed of 40 ft. A mermaid named <strong>Iolaah</strong> (CG merfolk @UUID[Actor.bwLvfvC1hzyUwujA]{Druid}) asks questions about the party's origins and purpose in this part of the ocean. If the heroes reveal their quest, Iolaah will become very interested and will want to take them to meet her father, Hywin.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hywin</strong> (NG merfolk @UUID[Actor.i7hNyi2lno1tHY2r]{Archmage}) resides in a beautiful translucent coral sphere. He is an enemy of Sydon, and he is willing to help anyone who opposes the Titan. He knows the entire history of Sydon and Lutheria and is willing to tell the tale. Afterwards, he breaks off a piece of coral for each character that has come to see him.</p>
                        <p>These simultaneously act as @UUID[Item.9xOdcWfCq8wqdFLx]{potions of water breathing} and @UUID[Item.g9R3J1se7jUnNl2o]{heroism} on anyone who swallows them. He wishes the party well on their quest.</p>
                        <p>Iolaah wishes to accompany the characters, but Hywin will forbid it. He tells the characters that Iolaah is impetuous and young and not ready for such an adventure. An hour after the ship sails away from the merfolk, a single dolphin swims alongside the ship. It transforms into Iolaah. She climbs aboard the ship and asks to accompany the heroes on their quest.</p>
                        <p>If the party refuses, she will be disappointed and she returns home safely. Otherwise, she joins the party on their quest. Iolaah is extraordinarily reckless in battle and unlikely to survive for very long. If she dies during the quest, Hywin will hold the party responsible. He may seek vengeance upon the heroes later.</p>

This central lump in the seabed is the nesting ground of a dreadful @UUID[Actor.ZunwFOwae2AlYxI4]{Hydra}. It eventually rises to the surface and attacks everyone who is on deck. This hydra is far bigger than most, with seven heads and maximum hit points.

While attacking, it communicates telepathically, demanding to know why the heroes have trespassed in its realm. It will quickly become clear to the Kraken that the heroes are enemies of Sydon. Once it has learned this, it will will sink back into the depths. If the heroes never mention Sydon, it will stop attacking after three rounds. The heroes can also offer a sacrifice worth 1,000 gp to appease the Kraken.</p>

                            <p>These simultaneously act as @UUID[Item.9xOdcWfCq8wqdFLx]{potions of water breathing} and @UUID[Item.g9R3J1se7jUnNl2o]{heroism} on anyone who swallows them. He wishes the party well on their quest.</p>
                            <p>Iolaah wishes to accompany the characters, but Hywin will forbid it. He tells the characters that Iolaah is impetuous and young and not ready for such an adventure. An hour after the ship sails away from the merfolk, a single dolphin swims alongside the ship. It transforms into Iolaah. She climbs aboard the ship and asks to accompany the heroes on their quest.</p>
                            <p>If the party refuses, she will be disappointed and she returns home safely. Otherwise, she joins the party on their quest. Iolaah is extraordinarily reckless in battle and unlikely to survive for very long. If she dies during the quest, Hywin will hold the party responsible. He may seek vengeance upon the heroes later.</p>
