        <p>The Cerulean Gulf is home to ten major islands that the heroes may explore. Only one of these islands has a critical objective that is necessary to advance the plot: the missing gear to the @UUID[Item.yu2yBFrBwvmUEEgr]{Antikythera}. The other islands offer chances for additional treasure and the opportunity to complete various heroic tasks for the party's epic paths.</p>

            <p>The party should probably spend a maximum of about one month exploring the Cerulean Gulf, remembering that it takes 2–3 days to sail between islands. Before the heroes can sail into the Forgotten Sea, they will need to recover the missing gear from the @UUID[Item.yu2yBFrBwvmUEEgr]{Antikythera}. The missing gear is in the possession of Chondrus on the <em>Island of Yonder</em> (area Y17).</p>

            <p>When the heroes arrive at an island, they can put down anchor—or beach their ship at a safe spot on shore. Some islands don't have anywhere to beach a ship, while other islands don't have suitable anchorages. If the text doesn't specify either, then you may allow your players to leave the ship wherever you feel is appropriate.</p>

            <p>Illustrated maps are provided for many of the islands in this region. These maps are intended to be handed out to players when they reach the islands. The maps give a sense of the geography of the island—they don't revealany information that needs to be kept hidden.</p>

                <p>Your ship glides through the shallow waters of this paradise and you make landfall on its pristine white beach without incident. The forests that stand before you are crowded with immense oak trees. There is a noticeable lack of anything man made in sight. A small herd of deer, curious and unafraid, make their way towards your vessel from the forest's edge.</p>

            <p>This island has been legendary for as long as there have been settlers in Thylea. Some of the Dragonlords landed on this island and came back with stories of animals that were almost divine in stature. These creatures were more beautiful and noble than any others of their kind. That didn't stop the Dragonlords from hunting them: one golden lion was caught and killed, and its hide was used to make a fabulous magical cloak.</p>
            <p>While such magnificent beasts have been found on Thylea's mainland, they have never been seen in the numbers that are reputed to be on this island. For centuries, sailors have sought out the island in hopes of taking the hide of a divine beast and selling it for a king's ransom in Mytros.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">

                    <p>This island has unparalleled natural beauty. It appears to be covered in dense forest, most of which are ancient oak and fir trees that loom to great heights. The dense forest is broken occasionally by clearings covered in tall, golden grass. At the very center of the island stands an enormous oak tree that towers more than two hundred feet into the air.</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">

                </div>
                <p>The tree at the center of the island is the Heart of Thylea. It is here that mortals and gods can speak with the Mother Goddess, Thylea herself.</p>
                <p>If someone is foolish enough to damage the tree, then two @UUID[Actor.NXVguuUD6B5iagff]{Hands of Kentimane} will erupt from the earth and attack them. If the hands are defeated, then @UUID[Actor.fbtYPqiLw63Nr3Ru]{Kentimane} himself will appear and annihilate all trespassers.</p>

                <p>Animals of all kinds are abundant on the island: tropical birds; large mammals such as deer, boar, sheep; and smaller creatures such as rabbits, beavers, possums and raccoons. Hunting is easy since none of the animals on the island have learned to fear humans or humanoids.</p>

                    <p>Anyone using the Wisdom (Survival) skill to hunt for food has advantage on such checks. If the heroes decide that they want to hunt some of the divine creatures on the island, they may use their Survival skill to track them. Survival rolls of 15+ reveal the tracks of a @UUID[Actor.Y89L5GGLWRycWurA]{Great Boar}. Rolls of 20+ reveal the tracks of a @UUID[Actor.nuldh3bPVV5dWhfZ]{Golden Lion} and his pride. Rolls of 25+ reveal the tracks of the @UUID[Actor.pyM42b7WRG1ZCfUe]{Golden Ram}. Tracking one of these animals requires [[/r 1d4+1]] hours, at which point the tracker establishes line of sight.</p>

                <p>The fruit trees on the island bear delicious apples that remain eternally fresh until eaten. Eating one of these apples has the same effect as a @UUID[Item.CiZBbo5EAjO7IxPK]{potion of healing}.</p>
                <p>If several barrels of apples are taken from the island, all but one barrel (containing 20 apples) will immediately ferment into cider. While delicious, the cider has no special healing effects.</p>

                    <p>Somewhere in the sky above, you hear a horse's whinny. Glancing upward, you see a white-winged creature gliding through the clouds. A flying horse—of all things—gracefully alights on a tall rock and watches you cautiously from a distance. You've heard stories of this creature. It's called a pegasus.</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">

                <p>This @UUID[Actor.GbMFB7FVMxZuwz4n]{Pegasus} is proud and pure of heart. It can only be approached by good-aligned heroes. If anyone of an evil alignment approaches the pegasus, it snorts contemptuously and flies away. Even a good-aligned character may provoke this reaction if they have ever performed an evil deed. In such a case, the character experiences a vision, a demanding memory of their past evil deed, just as the pegasus flies away.</p>
                <p>If one hero proves worthy enough to approach the pegasus, then it may be bonded to that hero with a @UUID[Item.Q1wNieWcJHLPKV9g]{pegasus bridle}. Such a bridle may be crafted at the Mithral Forge. Once tamed, the pegasus will join the heroes on the <em>Ultros</em>. Its favorite food is the perpetually fresh @UUID[Item.CR3HXV6IU85zhRpC]{eternal apples} that can be collected on this island.</p>

                <p>The ram runs from the party using its full movement speed, making its way to the center of the island. It climbs the hill where the great oak tree of Thylea stands. Once it gets to the top, it uses its ability to fly to easily outdistance pursuers and hide in the forest.</p>
                <p>This chase serves the purpose of bringing the heroes to the point where they can commune with Thylea, the Mother Goddess. The golden ram knows that all worthy heroes should be brought to this place.</p>

At first, the heroes will only hear the roar of lions in the distance. Within a few minutes, anyone with a passive Perception score of 15 or higher will notice that they are being hunted.</p>
                <p>The lions are good hunters, and they will wait to pounce until the heroes are in a vulnerable position. For example, they might attack just before the party gets back to the <em>Ultros</em>. The lions have advantage on all of their Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>

                <p>Your ship approaches a curved island that wraps around a wide blue lagoon. A small, craggy mountain marks the island's high point. Despite the lagoon's calm waters, a number of abandoned ships dot the shore. Most are intact, but some have obviously begun to succumb to age and rot. No other signs of civilization can be seen within the natural harbor of the lagoon, only the hulks.</p>

            <p>An unusually aggressive @UUID[Actor.UHasVVLgaETn3jvZ]{Chimera} (maximum HP) lives on this island. It has preyed upon Thylean merchant ships for nearly five decades, and has a treasure trove that is now legendary among sailors. King Acastus has offered a 1,000 gp bounty for the beast's death.</p>

                <p>The small island is a crescent with a small mountain marking the center of the curved ridgeline. Near the top of the mountain is the chimera's cave lair.

However, while in Hades the creature can make a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check to find the path that the hag coven uses to travel between the mortal realm and the plane of Hades.</p>

                <p>Although the sea is calm, finding a safe place to come ashore on this rocky island is a difficult task. There is one obvious place to make landfall: a stone dock on the island's only beach. A lone figure stands upon the dock, watching warily as your ship approaches. Vegetation grows by the shore, but there are no trees.</p>

            <p>For more than a century, this island has served as a prison colony for exiles. There are several small fishing boats tied up at the stone dock. One of the exiles is always on watch at the dock to alert the community when new arrivals make landfall.</p>
            <p>Criminals from Mytros accused of heinous crimes (such as murder) are sometimes exiled to this island for the rest of their lives. Mytrosian justice also allows for powerful citizens to be exiled by popular consent. When this happens, the exiles are ferried to the island, where they must remain for at least a decade.</p>
            <p>The sailing route to the island is a well-kept secret known only to King Acastus and his closest advisors. This is not a secret that Acastus shares with the heroes, as too many of his personal enemies are on the rocky island. The island has no large trees for good reason: no trees mean no wood for boat building. The island is mostly covered in bushes and small fig trees which are entirely unsuitable for any nautical purposes.</p>

                        <p>The inhabitants of the island are an eclectic group who have learned to live together. Every year they vote for a new "king."This king is a moderator for disputes. He decides how to punish those who transgress against the small community's rules.</p>
                        <p>There are 25 men (CE, NE and LN commoners) and three women (NE nobles) in the community. The most important members of the community are:</p>

A charismatic man, Stavros was one of the most successful wine merchants in all of Thylea. He claims to have been exiled by popular vote, but in reality, he was sent to the island for poisoning a rival. Stavros is paranoid that a new prisoner or exile will reveal his lie, but so far, no one has shown up on the island who knows the truth about his past.</p>

His obvious "eccentricities"are overlooked because he is the island's best woodworker, stone mason, and architect. He was sent to the island for murdering six women in Stygian Row.

He feels that he deserves his fate on the island as he killed his brother in a fit of anger while arguing over a woman. Keelan is well respected by the other exiles, but this is not reciprocal. He detests everyone on the island, but he is careful not to let it show. He will urge the heroes not to free anyone from the island, because they all deserve to be here—or much worse.</p>

Six of the younger exiles are besotted by his words, but he has yet to be elected king, because everyone else knows that he's a small-minded blowhard. Tyrone will constantly badger the heroes to let him and his followers accompany them on their voyage. If he is rebuffed, he becomes angry, but he is too much of a coward to do anything about it.</p>

Idylla was exiled from Mytros because she is Acastus's mother, and many citizens felt that she was abusing her influence over the king in the early years of his reign. The nobility banded together to have her exiled. Acastus was outwardly distraught, but secretly, he was glad to be rid of his overbearing mother. Idylla is regarded as the most beautiful woman on the island. Many of the men vie for her favor, but she has been careful not to play favorites. If Idylla senses that she can convince a hero to take her off of the island, she will use her considerable charm to seduce them. She dotes on Acastus, but she has no loyalty to him, and she has no qualms betraying him if it means escaping the island.</p>

                        <p>King Stavros attempts to greet the heroes as soon as they arrive on the island. He approaches them with six other exiles, including Idylla and Keelan. He introduces himself and explains the nature of the island. He is quite open about their status as exiles and "criminals"in Mytros. He questions the heroes as to their purpose, but he will quickly steer the conversation to the problem he needs solved—a problem that is causing much distress to the island's makeshift community.</p>
                        <p>Someone is murdering the other exiles. Four men have already been killed, all with their throats neatly cut. Idylla thinks it must be the recluse Tadd, while Stavros suspects that Tyrone is trying to supplant him. Keelan feels that jumping to conclusions doesn't help anything, as the murderer could be anyone, including one of the three of them. Stavros and Idylla want the heroes to investigate the murders—since they've just arrived, everyone agrees that they are neutral in the dispute.</p>
                        <p>If the heroes agree, then they will find that everyone is tight-lipped about the murders, and all four bodies have been burned, leaving no remains. Unless some means of talking to the spirits of the murdered people can be found, solid evidence is difficult to find. However, if the party can come up with a convincing case against someone on the island, Stavros and Idylla will be satisfied. Keelan will not be happy with any explanation.</p>
                        <p>There are three possible explanations for the murders. You can choose any of the following to be true:</p>
                        <ul class="rd__list">
                            <li class="rd__li ">
                                <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Idylla's Theory.</span></p>
                                <p>Idylla believes that the most likely murderer is Tadd. He's a strange man, and he can offer no coherent account of his whereabouts over any period of time. He could easily kill someone and then instantly forget that he did it. He's also a monster.</p>

                                <p>Tyrone is not the killer, but two of his men could be responsible. He has no idea whether they actually did it, but it would flatter him if they did. They've assaulted people who have spoken out against him in the past. Murder would be the natural next step, and his detractors deserve it, in any case.</p>

He loathes everyone on the island, but no one suspects him of murder, because everyone just assumes that he's as genial as his placid exterior suggests.

                    <p>This island is famed for the "Scorpion Tribe,"a lineage of cursed @UUID[Actor.U93UUfo9H42V9EXi]{centaurs} who have lived here for centuries. The centaurs of this tribe are doomed to transform into monstrous @UUID[Actor.1paQRlFZsrAII5tC]{giant scorpions} when they reach adulthood.

                    <p>Scorpions of every size and color live on the island, including the giant scorpions that used to be centaurs. The curse is the work of the <strong>Lotus Witch</strong>, a powerful @UUID[Actor.243HQzjsVwIkNgdE]{Gynosphinx} that lives in the tower at the center of the island. The sphinx keeps to herself. Those foolish enough to approach her tower never return.</p>
                    <p>The centaurs here are all young and impetuous. There are no elders to temper their youth with wisdom, because the adults all leave the island or transform into scorpions. The knowledge that so many are doomed by the curse makes the centaurs wild, as they know that life can be very short. They band together into groups of twelve—racing, drinking, hunting, and frolicking. They avoid the giant scorpions.</p>

                    <p>But the island's centaurs, who had long been charged with protecting the forest, chopped it down for firewood. As punishment for this reckless destruction of knowledge, the Lotus Witch cursed the centaurs—and they became known as the Scorpion Tribe.</p>

                        <p>There is no way to enter the tower from the air. Those who try to enter the tower by flying will meet sudden cross-winds, and storm clouds will appear in the sky where there were none before.</p>
                        <p>Every round, a @UUID[Item.TeRzT0AMTpPY2LkS]{lightning bolt} will strike any flyers for 28 ([[/damage 8d6 type=lightning]]) damage. A successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw will halve this damage. The bolts will not stop until a flyer lands or turns away and retreats to more than 1,000 ft. from the tower.

                            <p>This room is filled with over a dozen children. Some are infants, barely able to toddle, while others are a few years old. Most of them clutch yellow flowers in their hands. Some are human and elves, while others are minotaurs and centaurs. Piled in the corners of the room are heaps of clothing and equipment that might have belonged to adult versions of these children.</p>

                        <p>These children are all victims of the sphinx. They are former adventurers, Aresian hopefuls, and centaurs who dared enter the tower and failed the sphinx's tests. She reduced them all to a youthful state and comes down every few years to keep them young. Some of the children are chronologically centuries old, but they have lived almost all of those years as children. The children collect the lotus flowers outside and press them into oils to be used by the sphinx.</p>
                        <p>The most helpful child is a five-year-old boy named <strong>Leander</strong> (NG @UUID[Actor.Sbjw2JFBT5oXBTuj]{Commoner}). Leander tells the heroes that they are in danger and that they shouldn't have come. He tells them that the Lotus Witch will be angry with them, and that they must now go see her and then beg for forgiveness. If asked where to find the Lotus Witch, the boy points upwards and tell them that she is at the top of the tower.</p>

                        <ul class="rd__list">
                            <li class="rd__li ">Who created the Myrmekes race? (Talieus)</li>

                            <li class="rd__li ">Who was the cruelest of the Dragonlords? (Estor)</li>
                            <li class="rd__li ">What happened to the City of the Sirens? (It sank.)</li>

                        <p>The sphinx will be satisfied if the heroes can answer three of the questions correctly. If this is the case, she will answer any five questions the heroes ask of her: she knows everything there is to know about Thylea and its history.

                        <p>If the heroes attack the Lotus Witch or fail to answer her questions, she attacks them. The tower is considered her lair, so she has access to all of her lair actions. The sphinx will not fight to kill—only to incapacitate. If she is reduced to half hit points, she will use her lair action to shift all of the combatant heroes and herself to one of the realms on the other side of the stairwell windows. You can choose which one.</p>
                        <p>If the party kills the sphinx, they will be transported back to the tower (if they are in another plane).

The Lotus Witch knows what happened to the dragons, but she is forbidden to reveal it due to the Oath of Peace.

                <p>Your ship glides through clear blue waters towards a rocky and verdant shore. A crescent archipelago to the south creates a lagoon between the sea and main island. Through the clear green water of the lagoon, you can see jagged rocks and coral reefs that must be carefully avoided.

            <p>This island is heavily forested, and it has many beaches that make excellent landings. The waters around the island are dangerous, with many reefs and sharp rocks. This is the home of the seafaring Indigo barbarians. The humans, elves, dwarves, and others in the Indigo Tribes inhabited the Cerulean Gulf islands long before the coming of the Dragonlords.</p>

                <p>More than a thousand years ago, hundreds of survivors from a series of shipwrecks washed ashore on the Gulf's islands. They were helped by the native races, including the nymphs and satyrs, and they were eventually able to build a fleet of small ships to sail the Cerulean Gulf. They discovered Indigo Island and settled here, calling themselves the Indigo Tribes, after the fields of dark blue flowers that carpet the island.</p>
                <p>When the Dragonlords came, the Indigo Tribes fought on the side of the Thylean natives as a naval force. They scored several significant victories, but they went back into hiding after the end of the First War. They have remained here for the past five centuries. Although the island's forests are plentiful with deer and boar, the tribes mostly depend upon fishing and raiding.</p>
            </div>

                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="968"><span class="entry-title-inner">Barbarian Raiders</span></h2>
                <p>Civilized, mainland Thyleans dismiss the Indigo Tribes as uncultured barbarians, worthy only of scorn. However, their fearlessness and naval prowess also inspire respect: the barbarians frequently raid settlements along the Cerulean Gulf.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Indigo barbarians are the best navigators in all of Thylea. They observe flocks of birds and track the movements of stars to travel the Cerulean Gulf. They consider their navigation skills to be sacred and would never share their techniques with an outsider. Some travel to Mytros and Estoria to experience the decadent lifestyle of the "mainlanders,"but all of them eventually return to their island home.</p>
            <p>The Indigo Tribes dress lightly and wield unusual steel weapons, which have been handed down from their ancestors, or forged by dwarves of the Whale tribe, rather than the common bronze weapons used on the mainland. They are tanned by wind and sun from time at sea. The most exotic part of their appearance are the spiraling patterns of blue tattoos that cover their bodies. Indigo barbarians wear tattoos to mark every significant event in their lives.</p>
            <p>There are several tribes on the island, each including several hundred members. The tribes are divided along racial lines, but they are united in their reverence of Thylea, the Great Mother. Each tribe is ruled by a chief and two or three thanes (CN @UUID[Actor.IBkCL5G1RSddw4zV]{berserkers}) <em class="ve-muted">was originally barbarian warriors</em>. The tribes are defended by a core group of fearless warriors (CN @UUID[Actor.IBkCL5G1RSddw4zV]{berserkers}), but all of the men and women in the tribe are able to fight (CN @UUID[Actor.F7PDqAcGfGGSO20J]{tribal warriors}).</p>

                <p>This tribe of elves is the most xenophobic of the islanders, and they are the masters of building the catamaran-style boats used by the Indigo barbarians to travel the Gulf. The boats are built so that they can be easily dismantled and hidden. They even have masts that can be used as a rain-catcher for fresh water on long voyages. The tribe is ruled by <strong>Dolphin</strong>, an elven woman (CN @UUID[Actor.L9AZ9PlSSXDbhE0A]{Wild Druid}). This name is taken by anyone who becomes chieftain.</p>

                <p>Ventis has taken to hunting the barbarians as food. Unlike most of her kind, Ventis is chaotic evil, as she has been raised from birth to hate any outsider race that settled in Thylea.

Loopywoopy announces beforehand that this battle is a ritual and not to the death. Her twelve barbarians (CG @UUID[Actor.IBkCL5G1RSddw4zV]{berserkers}) <em class="ve-muted">was originally barbarian warriors</em> will not use lethal force unless the heroes use it against them.

                    <p>Twelve short tattooed humanoids approach your party. Though their tiny faces contort themselves in expressions meant to convey menace, their weapons remain sheathed. A middle-aged gnome approaches you with a confident stride. She wears an ornate headdress that nearly swallows her features.</p>
                    <p>"I, Chief Loopywoopy of the great Tribe of the Eel, wish to welcome you to Indigo Island! Do you outsiders care to prove your might against my people's greatest warriors? Stow your weapons! Testing your mettle requires no bloodshed."</p>

                <p>If the heroes are able to defeat the band, they are asked to a great feast in their honor. At the feast, satyrs play music, nymphs dance in the moonlight, and the gnomes and halflings drink copious amounts of liquor. The drink is a sweet-tasting rum made from sugarcane found deep in the island interior. Read the following:</p>

                    <p>The full moon hangs in the clear night sky, providing a picturesque backdrop for the feast. Satyrs serenade you with their pipes while nymphs, halflings, and gnomes dance around the flickering fire. You never quite finish your sweet, potent drink, as your hosts are quick to fill your cup back up to its brim. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol, smoked fish, and fresh sweat.</p>

                    <p>The festivities are cut short by a most unwelcome guest. The triangular silhouette of a copper dragon glides in front of the full moon and swoops down to attack the party. Firelight reflects from her glimmering metallic scales. She spews a stream of acid that singes the edge of Chief Loopywoopy's headdress.</p>

            <p>This strange island consists of three perfectly molded green hills surrounded by an impossible glass dome that rises out of the Cerulean Gulf. The glass dome encompasses the entire island. The wall is impervious to damage, but it can easily be bypassed by teleportation magic such as @UUID[Item.4bvkWN1lE3zIHDrZ]{teleport} or @UUID[Item.5a0yO6vF5jvNCHz9]{dimension door}. Anchoring at the glass wall is trivial.</p>
            <p>Most natives of Thylea know of the legend of the island and will share it with the heroes. Any crewmen on the <em>Ultros</em> will almost certainly know that this is Titan's Folly. They are quite sure that this a place that must be avoided at all costs.</p>
            <p>While the island is rumored to be home to Thylea's greatest treasures, it was sealed away by Kentimane the Hundred Handed. His reasons for doing this are a complete mystery, even to the other gods. Legend suggests that the original war among the Titans was a direct result of whatever happened here. Thylean natives among the crew will warn the heroes to turn away and forget they ever saw this place.</p>

                    <p>Once you have bypassed the curious glass dome, you continue toward the island. The most striking aspect of the place is its perfect geometric uniformity. The land consists of three identical green hills clumped together. Thick tropical grass grows in rows around each hill, interrupted only by rows of oak trees halfway to each hill's summit. Such a perfect land formation can only be the handiwork of the Mother Goddess, Thylea.</p>

                <p>The three hills are entirely covered in perfectly arranged fields of sugarcane. Each hill has a ring of ancient oak trees that circles the hill at the midpoint of the slope. Under the oak trees are entrances to a network of caves and tunnels.</p>
                <p>The Titan Kentimane sealed this island away five millennia ago. It hasn't had a single visitor from the outside world in all that time. Inside the barrier, on this strange island, lives a race of creatures that don't exist anywhere else in the multiverse: the <strong>myrmekes</strong>.</p>
                <p>The myrmekes are a race of hyper-intelligent insectlike humanoids that were created by one of Thylea's children at the dawn of time. There are around 3,000 myrmekes on the island, and they live in the caves beneath the oaks, where they store their food, raise their young and protect their queen.</p>

They won't stop the heroes from leaving early, and they will not restrict the party's movements on the island. If the heroes attack the myrmekes, they will defend themselves but will not retaliate. They will wait until the heroes exhaust themselves and then ask them, somewhat regretfully, to leave.</p>

They will dispute the notion that Thylea imprisoned them, as she was their creator. If they are asked about powerful magical items, they will claim to have no ideas about such things. The truth is that the myrmekes' powerful hive mind is able to influence the unconscious minds of nearby humanoids.</p>

                <p>The myrmekes study everything that the heroes do and everything that they bring with them. Magic spells are especially interesting to them, as they have very little experience with magic.</p>
                <p>Once the heroes have left the island, the myrmekes will begin to plan their escape from the island. They will copy whatever method the heroes used to bypass the wall. For example, if the heroes used the @UUID[Item.5a0yO6vF5jvNCHz9]{dimension door} spell, then the myrmekes now know how to use it.</p>
                <p>At this point the myrmekes will begin working toward what they feel is their destiny: making the multiverse a reflection of their perfect society and people.</p>
                <p>They will then send boats to the mainland where they will capture Thyleans and learn everything they can from them. This happens very quickly while the heroes are busy with their own affairs. Within a few weeks, the heroes might have the following encounter:</p>

                    <p>A fine galley ship sails towards your party. As it approaches, you find that the vessel is crewed and captained by a group of humanoid insects, the curious myrmekes you encountered not long ago.</p>
                    <p>Despite the short amount of time that has passed, the myrmekes have changed considerably. They now wear bronze armor and wield bronze weapons. They are no longer the friendly and inquisitive creatures of Titan's Folly. As these myrmekes approach, they look positively defiant and warlike.</p>

                <p>The ship is crewed by 30 @UUID[Actor.pRJRrsVNzwbwaAnC]{myrmekes advanced}. The myrmekes will attack the party's ship using tactics that would impress even the most jaded Aresian warrior monk. Six myrmekes advanced bombard the heroes with @UUID[Item.xSUjkVbBqnofP454]{rays of frost} as a disciplined phalanx of ten myrmekes advanced attempts to board the ship.</p>
                <p>If the heroes are able to survive this encounter, they begin to hear rumors of armies of insect men conquering outlying towns and villages. Initially the stories describe armies of hundreds of myrmekes, but after one month, the rumors describe an unstoppable army of more than a thousand myrmekes with advanced magic and siege weapons.</p>
                <p>The myrmekes grow more advanced with each passing month, and the size of their army doubles just as quickly. If they aren't stopped, they will conquer all of Thylea and convert it into one giant ant colony. Then they will seek out new lands to conquer. These events are beyond the scope of this book, but they might form the basis of a future campaign.</p>

                            <p>Carefully hidden from prying eyes, a narrow stairway has been carved into the cliff side. Below, a faint orange glow shines through cracks in the volcano's dark crust, betraying the inferno beneath.</p>

                            <p>Pulling out a single stake makes a walkway bridge unstable, and anyone on it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be thrown into the caldera below.

                            <p>Pulling both stakes out makes the bridge collapse, and anyone less than 10 feet from one end can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to leap to safety.

The cave's sole resident, a 9-foot-tall cyclops, sits at a stone table at the center of the room. He wears a monocle over his eye, and he has remarkably nimble, ten-fingered hands. He is tinkering with what appears to be a half-finished mechanical goat. Other clockwork animals fill niches that have been carved into the cavern wall opposite the forge.</p>

He is a jancan, a rare breed of cyclops born with ten fingers on each hand and ten toes on each foot. Jancan are natural blacksmiths, although Steros is unusual in that he is somewhat of a runt when compared to most of his kind.</p>
                        <p>Steros is not immediately hostile, and will try to make conversation with anyone who enters his forge. He will, however, use the power of his monocle to gain the upper hand in any conversation or battle that takes place.</p>

                            <p>Sydon sent Steros to serve the Firewalkers after their previous jancan was captured in a raid by the Amazons of Themis. The previous jancan was named Bront, and he was Steros's father.</p>
                            <p>Since his arrival, Steros has built himself a small forge that he keeps heated with the help of a pair of fire snakes. Using this forge, he builds weapons for the Firewalkers, a task that he considers to be beneath his considerable skills. He spends most of his time tinkering with new and strange contraptions to amuse himself. These mechanical contraptions are arranged in niches carved into the cave. There are many creatures in the niches, some of them unfinished, others smashed.</p>
                            <p>Steros' most prized possession is the monocle that he wears at all times. This has several lenses that can be used, by swinging them into place inside the short frame:</p>

                            <p>He always keeps the red lens in place, so that he has advantage on all of his Wisdom (Perception) checks (passive Perception 14), and because they aid his work.</p>

                <p>The Island of Yonder has been taken over by the Order of Sydon, a faction of zealots who are fiercely devoted to Sydon, the Lord of Storms.</p>
                <p>The Order intends to destroy the heroes. They are an effective, organized force. Unlike some other groups in the Cerulean Gulf, the Order of Sydon are highly coordinated and prepared for interlopers. This makes them far more difficult to deal with than most of the dangers that the heroes have encountered so far.</p>
                <p>@UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#commander-gaius]{Gaius}, the commander of the Order, is a very clever leader and a cunning strategist. He will not throw away the lives of his men in a piecemeal fashion, and he will not order them to fight to the death unless he has no other choice. He is a dangerous man. For as long as the heroes are on this island, they should feel the pressure of Gaius and his forces breathing down their neck.</p>
                <p>@UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019#chondrus]{Chondrus}, the master of the Great Library, is also here. He is not loyal to Gaius, but he provides assistance to the Order when called for. Both Gaius and Chondrus were present when the heroes were called before King Acastus, and they remember the heroes well.</p>

                <p>This island was the ancient capital of the Gygan Empire that once dominated much of Thylea. The gygans were already in decline when the Dragonlords arrived, but most of those that remained were wiped out in the First War. The gygan communities and forts on Yonder were razed by the Dragonlords in the last days of the struggle.</p>
                <p>In the last decade, the Order of Sydon has made the island their main base of operations. The few gygans who still lived on the island were eager to work with the Order and thereby gain favor with Sydon. They believe that this, perhaps, is a chance to return to the glory of ages past.</p>
                <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1028"><span class="entry-title-inner">Structures and Ruins</span></h3>
                    <p>Two buildings have been mostly reconstructed by the Order and the gygans. One is a small tower close to the cove that allows landfall. The other is a magnificent library near the center of the island. The rest of the island is covered in ruins from the ancient gygan civilization. There are a half-dozen sites that show broken marble pillars and slabs of concrete, some of which are partially charred by dragon fire.</p>
                    <p>The skeletal remains of gygans are everywhere in these ruins. The few living gygans avoided the ruins out of superstitious fear of the long dead. There are animals on the island, but they are mostly seagulls and small animals such as rats and shrews.</p>

                    <p>The many ruins across the island have been mostly picked clean by the Order of Sydon. All that remains are the bones of the gygans who died five centuries ago. The gygans who still live on Yonder leave these bones in the open as a reminder of the evils that the Dragonlords visited upon their people.</p>
                    <p>Because of the atrocities of Estor Arkelander, the <em>Ultros</em> is a ship that the gygans have never forgotten, and anyone who comes to the island aboard the legendary ship will be an immediate target of the gygans' wrath.</p>

                <p>This tower's main purpose is to house a small garrison of soldiers who protect the island and the Library. The tower is guarded by a detachment of 16 @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{soldiers} from the Order of Sydon and 2 @UUID[Actor.bK3oCr1I4IMrDbgP]{gygans} led by <strong>Marcion</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain}). One of the gygans is always on watch and will alert the tower if he sees a ship approaching.</p>
                <p>Once Marcion becomes aware of the heroes, he will send one of his men to inform Gaius at the library. Marcion will try to ensure that the garrison remains in the tower unless ordered otherwise by Gaius or Chondrus. However, if the Ultros makes anchor within visible range of the tower, Marcion will be unable to stop the two gygans in his garrison from going down to try and kill anyone coming to shore.</p>

                <p>The ancient library, now rebuilt, is in the middle of a ruined gygan city. It is both the headquarters of the Order's supreme commander and the location of the Order's most important project. The path here from the cove is easy to spot, as it is frequently used.</p>
                <p>Sydon is obsessed with arcane lore and the Order are gathering such knowledge from as many unique sources as possible. They have been using three main methods:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Gathering scrolls and tomes from across Thylea.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Capturing shipwrecked sailors from the outer world.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Using all sorts of magic to learn forbidden secrets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most of the Order think that the library is somehow giving them information through such spells as @UUID[Item.uMDqU1gJlctS9wN7]{contact other plane} and @UUID[Item.mk97LLr9MF2V6CPk]{legend lore}, but this is not all that has been happening. Chondrus, the master of the library, has been making deals with the yugoloths of Hades. The library also has a half-dozen scholars (LE @UUID[Actor.9jfUjuUxX4knw0D4]{nobles}) to tend to the books and scrolls, along with four @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{acolytes} who study arcane lore, conduct magical experiments, and use divination magic to look beyond Thylea.</p>
                <p>Finally, the library is also home to soldiers and gygans under command of Gaius, the supreme commander of the Order of Sydon.</p>

                    <p>The cliffs surrounding the library are 200 ft. in height. The cliffs are steep and require a successful DC 15 Strength (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check to scale. The Order of Sydon doesn't patrol the cliffs, so it's a dangerous but effective way to stealthily gain entry to the library.</p>

                    <p>While Gaius may have learned that strangers have made landfall on Yonder, he is confident that sending out one of his captains should deal with the threat. The garrison at the library will not become alert until intruders are seen approaching the gates—or until a fight breaks out inside the walls. If the library is alerted to intruders, all of the soldiers in both barracks will be roused. The walls and towers at the front gate will be reinforced, and a warband will be dispatched to intercept the heroes. The warband includes six @UUID[Actor.ZYuckKZyAoKP7FVW]{soldiers}, one @UUID[Actor.bK3oCr1I4IMrDbgP]{Gygan}, and a @UUID[Actor.4fqGc9tjKnoy34bu]{Captain} with orders to kill the heroes.</p>

                    <p>If the library hasn't been alerted, then Gaius can be encountered in his quarters. However, if Gaius is alerted to intruders, he will summon his mount, <strong>Argyn</strong> (LE @UUID[Actor.IlO2sLaK4hfJnCtJ]{Young Silver Dragon}), and wait for her before engaging in battle. Gaius can summon Argyn by blowing a whistle that hangs around his neck.</p>
                    <p>Argyn is usually hunting dolphins and whales in the waters close to the island, and it will take her about ten minutes to return. If the heroes leave the library before Argyn arrives, then Gaius will mount up and search for their ship from the air. Once he finds the ship, he will attempt to kill everyone onboard. If the heroes have not yet encountered Sydon's fleet, then he may summon them to his aid.</p>

Color variations in the masonry suggest that this is an ancient building that has recently been restored. The massive bronze doors at the entrance stand closed. They are engraved with images depicting six-armed cyclopes.</p>
                        <p>Despite the pristine condition of the building itself, the statuary and carvings that surround it are crumbling. The most prominent statue is a six-armed figure with a bronze cage where its head should be.</p>

The two massive bronze doors are always kept closed, but they are not locked. The bronze doors are embossed with images from the ancient gygan civilization, including scenes of the gygans building their cities, worshipping the Titans, and sailing the seas of Thylea.</p>

He is possibly the most valuable prisoner that the Order has ever captured, because unlike other expeditions from the outer world, Mikhael arrived in an airship. He and his crew made it past the dangers of the Forgotten Sea, but eventually, Sydon sent rocs to destroy the airship and take its captain for interrogation.</p>
                        <p>Mikhael has revealed many magical secrets under interrogation, but he has never revealed his origins. He is a shadow of his former self, and years of torture have nearly broken him. If he is freed, he will quickly return to the vigorous and vainglorious man he was once, years before his capture. He strongly believes that the engine of his airship can be salvaged and that he can probably retrofit it to the <em>Ultros</em> or another ship.</p>
                        <p>Unless you want the heroes to have such a device, Mikhael will be disappointed if he ever finds the wreck of his ship, as the engine has been removed. It is lost somewhere in the depths of the Cerulean Gulf.</p>

                    <p>Six scholars (LE @UUID[Actor.rXL6URGHnQpukATp]{acolytes}) tend to the books in this vast library during the day. Two @UUID[Actor.bK3oCr1I4IMrDbgP]{gygans} guard the library at all times.</p>

                        <p>The Great Library contains several volumes about the dragons that disappeared at the end of the First War. Balmytria is known to be dead, because her body is interred in her tomb at Telamok. The other four dragons were last seen in the vicinity of <em>The Golden Heart</em>. One book speculates that the dragons were captured by the Titans, but Chondrus has written notes in the margin suggesting that he knows this to be false. He believes that they were not captured but rather transformed into something else.</p>

            <p>Themis is the largest island in the Cerulean Gulf and consists of relatively flat grassland with small copses of trees. There is one deep, safe bay on the western edge of the island that is an ideal anchorage. Another deep bay on the eastern edge of the island is too dangerous for ships to enter due to jagged rocks that break the surface.</p>

            <p>Themis has different fauna from the rest of Thylea, including tropical animals such as antelopes, giraffes, lions, hyenas, and rhinoceroses. Tales of these creatures are told far and wide, but what truly makes the island famous are its legendary denizens: the Amazons.</p>

                <p>Centuries ago, the Amazons of Themis were counted among the diverse warrior-tribes of Indigo Island. But during the First War, their forces were entirely shattered by the armies of the Titans. Blaming their losses on the frailty of the men who surrounded them, they sought to isolate themselves from the rest of Thylea and create a stronger society: a society dominated by female warriors. Accordingly, they retreated to the remote island of Themis and established an isolated kingdom, unspoiled by the weakness of men.</p>
                <p>The Amazons are as racially diverse as the tribes of Indigo Island, including elves, dwarves, gnomes, and even native races such as sirens and minotaurs. The Amazons define themselves as a sacred band of warriors who always stand together as a sisterhood. They train for combat from an early age, and once they come of age, they form into pairs of sister-warriors: lifemates.</p>
                <p>There are only a few thousand Amazons on Themis, but they are among the most feared warriors in all of Thylea—brutal berserkers with no mercy. They have been known to take prisoners for breeding purposes, but most of them are executed.</p>

                    <p>Amazonian lifemates fight side-by-side with deadly coordination. In the event that an Amazon witnesses the death of her lifemate, she will enter a berserk state where she gains advantage on all melee attacks. Enemies gain advantage on attacks made against her in this state.</p>

                    <p>The Amazons of Themis are currently led by Queen Thesilea VI, the sixth of her name and "first amongst equals."Despite this title, Thesilea VI and her two sisters rule the Amazons with absolute power, backed by the authority of Lutheria. There has been no equality among the Amazons for over a decade.</p>
                    <p>The three sisters wear sacred platinum helmets that signify obedience to Lutheria and elevate them above the rest of the sisterhood. The helmets also conceal a dangerous truth: Thesilea and her sisters are actually medusae who murdered the previous queen thirteen years ago and replaced her. None of the other Amazons on the island suspect this terrifying truth, and few would believe it without damning evidence.</p>

                    <p>When the imposter queen came to power thirteen years ago, she converted all the shrines on the island and enforced the worship of Lutheria. There was initial resistance to this change, but it was soon quashed by a campaign of fear and public execution. Those who survived are grudgingly loyal to the throne.</p>
                    <p>Some of Lutheria's servants dwell among the Amazons to watch over them and ensure their loyalty. There is a small band of @UUID[Actor.etZHx4dLS7jMrBsg]{maenads} who rove across the island, accompanied by their children (@UUID[Actor.XCfvQueH2aXzTSRG]{goatlings}) and some leering men (@UUID[Actor.DeD0njf9CfukCiBL]{cultists}).

                    <p>Men are tolerated on the island only for the purposes of procreation—they have no voice in civic affairs or in the raising of children. Amazons disdain men as a rule, but there are some who have a sympathetic opinion of the weaker sex. Such women might love a man the way they love a faithful dog—anything more would be taboo.</p>
                    <p>Men who are captured on the island may be thrown into prison and evaluated for suitability as breeding stock. Queen Thesilea keeps a small selection of young men for this purpose at an underwater temple on a small island off the coast of Themis. These men have been raised since they were children to believe that they are the favored sons of Lutheria. But on their eighteenth birthdays, they are escorted out of the temple and turned to stone.</p>

Many of the shattered pieces are in the shapes of human limbs and faces.

                            <p>The Amazons have transformed this hydra into a monstrous and powerful guardian. A hydra can have a practical maximum of thirteen heads; beyond that count the heads start to become more of a hindrance than a help, and a hydra with more than thirteen heads will eat the extra heads when it gets hungry.</p>
                            <p>Each extra head after the fifth one adds 10 HP to a hydra's hit point total to a maximum of 252 HP. When a hydra gains more than thirteen heads, it stops gaining extra hit points and becomes unbalanced. The 14+ headed hydra's heads have disadvantage on their attacks. For each head after the thirteenth, the hydra's walk and swim speed are reduced by 5 feet. A hydra with 19 heads is therefore completely immobile.</p>
                            <p>The hydra in the Sacred Temple has ten heads (222 HP). The hydra is able to attack each 5 ft. square of the hallway with two of its heads. If it is reduced to less than five heads, it will retreat back to its lair.</p>

                    <p>This is where the breeding stock of men are kept until they come of age. There are usually four young men in the room (CN @creature[Commoner|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|commoners]), with the rest in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#p10.-breeding-chambers]{Breeding Chambers} (P10). They have been raised since birth to be absolutely loyal to the Amazons. They will not attack intruders, but they won't help them either.</p>
                    <p>If given a chance, the men will try to raise the alarm. Attempts to convince them of their cruel situation will fall upon deaf ears. They believe that they are the blessed sons of Lutheria and that they will become immortal when they are transformed into stone.</p>
                    <p>The heroes can shatter the beliefs of one of the men with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. He will not be of much help, however, as his knowledge is limited to the rooms on this level.</p>

                    <p>If the heroes ask about the whereabouts of @UUID[Item.GjZUXctedbq2YdBs]{Titansbane}, the legendary sword, he will explain that Thesilea grew annoyed with it and fed it to the hydra.</p>
