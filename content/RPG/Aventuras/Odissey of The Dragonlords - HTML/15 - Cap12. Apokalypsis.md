        </div>
        <p>One of Thylea's godlike beings has hatched a plan that will bring ruin to everything that the heroes have fought and suffered for. The primordial monsters that have remained imprisoned in the Nether Sea since the dawn of time will be unleashed upon the world. These creatures will annihilate Thylea's greatest cities. Unless the heroes figure out how to stop these titanic engines of destruction, the world will come to an apocalyptic end.</p>
        <p>This adventure should serve as an explosive finale to your campaign. By the end of the Apokalypsis, the heroes will be 20th level and will have most likely achieved the prerequisites to becoming gods. This chapter works best if the heroes have completed the adventure described in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014]{Sunken Kingdom} chapter, but it's not required. In any event, it is suggested that several years have passed since the Battle of Mytros.</p>

                    <p>Even if the heroes killed Lutheria, the Mistress of Death can be one of the villains of this chapter. She had a pact with powerful daemonic masters on the plane of Hades. After spending years as a pitiful larva, she fulfilled her end of the bargain, and the overlords of Hades sent Lutheria back to the mortal world. Now, she lurks in the shadows of her abandoned temples, weakened but filled with a sense of renewed purpose.</p>
                    <p>Seeing what has happened to Thylea in her absence has infuriated Lutheria beyond measure. The mortals who defeated her are celebrated as the new Dragonlords, while she and her husband have been forgotten. Lutheria feels that this 'bold new world' is a joke. Accordingly, she has prepared a much funnier and crueler joke: the total eradication of every living thing in Thylea. She will accomplish this by unleashing the <em>Weapons of the Gods</em> from the Nether Sea upon the surface world.</p>

                    <p>Deep within the Sunken Kingdom, the lost pantheon of empyreans created by the angel, Phaeros, have waited for thousands of years for their chance to rule Thylea. Now it seems that their time has finally arrived. If they have not already been released from their temples by the heroes, then Lutheria releases them now.</p>
                    <p>Lutheria has laid events in motion that will allow the Empyreans to ascend to godhood. She is a shadow of her former self—no longer strong enough to battle the heroes on her own. The best that she can do is unleash the Nether Titans upon the world, giving the Empyreans an opportunity to take vengeance on her behalf.</p>
                    <p>Once the Dragonlords are weakened by their battles against the Titans, the Empyreans plan to destroy the heroes and take credit for saving the people of Thylea from the Apokalypsis. Then, the Empyreans can transform themselves into true gods using the three Divine Artifacts that the heroes have so helpfully recovered: the @UUID[Item.kuJGgGBuqPaPmrrv]{Caduceus}, the @UUID[Item.9qrdfpdKLI5XFTMy]{Ambrosia}, and the @item[Promethean Fire|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords].</p>

                        <p>The Apokalypsis does not need to be a scheme hatched by Lutheria if that doesn't fit the needs of your campaign. You can replace her with someone else, though this villain works best if it has a strong personal connection to the heroes. Here are some suggestions:</p>

                <p>The Apokalypsis works best when the heroes have a lot invested in the fate of Thylea. This investment can be accomplished through game sessions with a focus on roleplaying. Alternatively, a game master can have the campaign skip forward by another year or two and describe how the world has changed and the heroes have prospered. If the heroes have new cities named after them, then those cities should have grown significantly. If the heroes are the leaders of a new Dragonlord order, then they should be widely revered as the new peacekeepers of Thylea. If they are kings or queens, then perhaps they have children now.</p>
                <p>If the heroes have recovered the Divine Artifacts, then they may already be on the path toward immortality. Many of the prerequisites to godhood described in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000024]{Divine Path} appendix can be accomplished over the course of this final, epic adventure.</p>

            <p>The story begins with the heroes facing down one of the last threats to peace in the lands of Thylea. It is an army that has been rampaging across the countryside, raiding towns, and destroying merchant caravans. The army should be led by an old enemy of the heroes.

                <p>You stand at the head of your army, gazing across the battlefield at the ranks of your enemy. Under the Order of Sydon, the remnants of the Titan armies have banded together one last time to lay waste to the realm. Centaurs, minotaurs, gygans, and cyclopes have joined forces with vengeful human soldiers to destroy everything that you have spent years building. But you are the Dragonlords—the sovereign peacekeepers of Thylea—and to challenge you means certain death.</p>

They have banded together to return the world to the way it was before the heroes overthrew the Titans. The leader of the army might be a resurrected Gaius. If not, feel free to replace him with another villain that survived the campaign. Alternatively, you can use Gaius's statistics to create a new leader of the Order of Sydon.</p>

            <p>Versi reveals that the <em>Weapons of the Gods</em> have been released from their prisons in the Nether Sea (N6).

            </ul>

                <p>Additionally, you should encourage the party to go after the magical artifacts. On the other hand, a group of six experienced players with optimized heroes will be able to defeat any single monster with little chance of defeat; even the dreaded tarrasque. For knowledgeable groups, we recommend that you provide less guidance. You might also want to exclude the artifacts and bolster the Nether Titans with the reinforcements suggested for each.</p>

                <p>Lutheria set the Apokalypsis in motion and convinced the Empyreans to take advantage of the chaos, but she never truly intended to allow them to become gods. Her plan is much more sinister.</p>
                <p>Lutheria intends to transform her @UUID[Item.FvDtbPzSttO1Rjr9]{sphere of annihilation} into an all-consuming god of oblivion. This new god will tear a hole in the fabric of reality, swallowing everything—the entire world of Thylea, gods and mortals alike. Each time one of the Empyreans falls in combat, she harvests their soul, and her pet @UUID[Item.FvDtbPzSttO1Rjr9]{sphere of annihilation} doubles in size.</p>
                <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                        <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Preventing Oblivion.</span></p>
                        <p>In order to create the god, Lutheria needs to collect the souls of all eight Empyreans. She watches the battle from the sidelines, laughing at the Empyreans as they fall in combat. She does not attack the heroes—in fact, she cheers them on, and she may even join in the battle to help them.</p>

                            <p></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The only way to prevent Lutheria's plan from succeeding is to spare at least one of the Empyreans from death. When there are only 2-3 Empyreans remaining, they realize this and beg the heroes for mercy.</p>

                        <p>When the battle is finished, the Furies arrive and pronounce judgment on Lutheria: she has broken her oath to the Empyreans, violating the most fundamental rule of godhood. As she slowly dissolves away into nothingness, Lutheria laughs uncontrollably at the irony of it all. The surviving Empyreans swear eternal fealty to the heroes.</p>

                <p>This is an appropriate place for your players to retire their heroes and create fresh characters, so that they can take on more mundane challenges once again.

                <p>It's also possible that the heroes have fulfilled all the necessary prerequisites to become gods, according to the rules laid out in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000024]{Divine Path} appendix.</p>
                <p>In this case, ask each of your players to write up an appropriate epilogue for their personal ascension to godhood. Future campaigns in Thylea should make use of this new pantheon of gods. If the heroes were natives of Thylea, then they might send future adventurers on quests to explore the world beyond the Forgotten Land.</p>

This is the dawn of a new era... perhaps not one of long-lasting peace, but a time when the gods are no longer at war with one another. At last, we are free to forge our own fates.</em>”</p>
