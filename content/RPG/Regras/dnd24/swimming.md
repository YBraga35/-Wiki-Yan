## Swimming

While you're swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed and use it to swim. At the DM's option, moving any distance in rough water might require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
