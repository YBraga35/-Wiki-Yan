        <p>The Nether Sea is dark and dangerous. Its inky waters are all that remain of the raw material that the gods used to fashion the world at the dawn of time. This sea of cosmic matter continues to exist for reasons that are hidden even from the gods. The sea is littered with rocky islands and rapids, and the islands are covered in strange, twisted trees and colossal forms.</p>
        <p>Although the Nether Sea is located within a vast underground cavern, the sky above is filled with colorful stars and galaxies. The cavern roof above the Nether Sea is almost a half-mile above the water. It is lined with vast lodes of silver and mithral. These deposits reflect the light that emanates from the stars, which are actually magical rifts connected to the Astral Plane.</p>
        <p>The Nether Sea is a vast prison vault where the gods have hidden ancient weapons and powerful creatures that have no place in the world above. It is also the domain of the Titan Lutheria, the Lady of Dreams. She travels the Nether Sea on her throne ship, a great bronze vessel called <em>Hypnos</em>, which is harnessed and pulled by Talieus, one of her ancient siblings.</p>

                <p>The Nether Sea is connected to the vast network of tunnels and caverns that makes up the world's Underdark. Sometimes creatures from the Underdark will stumble into the realm of the Nether Sea, but without a powerful ship like the <em>Ultros</em>, they are unable to make it very far before succumbing to the chaos of its primordial waters.</p>

            <p>There are two ways to get to the Nether Sea. Neither of these methods are well known, even among the gods. They must be discovered through research or by seeking out extremely wise creatures, such as sphinxes.</p>

                <p>The River Lethe empties into a huge rift called <em>The Dead Falls</em>, which descends all the way to the Nether Sea. This method is extremely dangerous, as the mile-long drop is enough to kill most creatures and shatter most ships. Estor Arkelander's ghost is aware of this method, but he refuses to share it with the party unless they have agreed to his bargain.</p>

                <p>After a few moments of disorientation, you assess your new surroundings. Monotonous black waves and alien skies stretch for as far as the eye can see. The stars are strange and unrecognizable. In stark contrast to the roiling oceans above, everything here is deathly silent. The smell of briney seawater has been replaced with a pervasive metallic odor. You can hear something sizzling against the hull of your ship.</p>

            <p>The Nether Sea is dangerous for many reasons, but the water itself is the most immediate risk. For one thing, the waters are acidic, and each day, they inflict 30 damage to the ship's hull. The <em>Ultros</em> has been magically protected from the waters of the Nether Sea, so it only takes 5 acid damage per day.</p>

The whale creatures have AC 22 and are immune to most conditions: &Reference[condition=blinded], &Reference[condition=charmed], &Reference[condition=frightened], &Reference[condition=paralyzed], and &Reference[condition=poisoned].

For example, the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#n6.-gargantuan-cubes]{Gargantuan Cubes} (N6) are prisons for powerful weapons.

He will whisper this almost unpronounceable primordial word to anyone who asks him for it. Whoever hears the word gains a random @UUID[RollTable.pG1sze9DSilZ3uaU]{short-term madness} (see the <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#DMG">Game Master's Guide</a>), but they cannot say the word until they stand before the locked entrance.

                    <p>Dim lights dance upon the horizon. As your ship moves closer, you discover their source: an immense, partially submerged crystalline structure reflects the strange light of this strange place. Countless flat panels connect at strange angles, creating a vaguely pyramid shape. Near the waterline is a gaping hole large enough to allow passage by the <em>Ultros</em>. Jagged edges suggest that this entryway was made by force rather than being an original feature of this odd structure.</p>

                <p>This huge crystal structure rises out of the Nether Sea. The @UUID[Actor.fqRdQAcUkcnMMqcg]{Kraken} was once imprisoned here, but it escaped and now dwells in the Forgotten Sea. A gaping hole near the water line allows access into the interior of the mirror prison. A ship such as the <em>Ultros</em> can sail into this hole to the interior of the crystal structure.</p>
                <p>The walls and ceiling of the interior are covered in hundreds of square mirrors, each 6 feet to a side. These mirrors reflect whoever enters the prison, and each mirror shows a warped version of the viewer. At the rear of the crystal structure's interior is a small island made from broken mirrors. Gold, silver, and gemstones are piled on the island in a large hoard.</p>

                    <p>This island is the lair of an @UUID[Actor.eS3aJ6cyAjnryvEj]{Adult Brass Dragon} named @UUID[Actor.Djk6iVbZkze89KS9]{Hezzebal}. Hezzebal was the mount of a Dragonlord who explored the Nether Sea five centuries ago, scouting for a location to hide the treasures of the Dragonlords. Hezzebal broke into the Mirror Prison and accidentally released the Kraken in the process. The Kraken sealed the dragon inside the prison and then tormented him by slowly and messily devouring his bonded Dragonlord.</p>
                    <p>Over centuries, the mirrors warped Hezzebal so that his wings became twisted, and his alignment has changed to evil. Hezzebal now lairs in the broken prison, occasionally going out into the Nether Sea to hunt.</p>
                    <p>Hezzebal usually lurks beneath the water, having become immune to the effects of the Nether Sea. He will surface to converse with intruders if they start to loot his dragon hoard. He will reveal his history to gain sympathy and will inquire about the party's purpose here.</p>

                        <p>If the Vanished One is present, then Hezzebal recognizes them as one of the ancient Dragonlords and blames them for his long imprisonment.

                    <p>Many centuries ago, when mortals first began to arrive on the shores of Thylea, Lutheria made a deal with an @UUID[Actor.pu5qFuIUwnqKwNby]{Ultroloth} from the bleak plane of Hades. This ultroloth became the warden of the prisoners brought to the <em>Island of the Oathbreakers</em>. When an erinyes arrives with an oathbreaker, the ultroloth chains the offender to the central column and threatens torture as punishment for attempting to escape.</p>

                        <p>The island is surrounded by an entropic field which sustains prisoners, eliminating the need for them to eat or drink, although they are perpetually hungry and thirsty. There are hundreds of mortals still alive on the island and thousands of corpses, some centuries dead. Every one of these prisoners is chained to the central column that rises from the center of the island.</p>

                            <p>As you approach the center of the island, you are able to make out the thousands of individual chains anchored in the great stone pillar. Held fast by the chains are the skeletal remains of many mortals. Some appear to be centuries old. Although there are some living prisoners, they ignore you. Most of them seem to have had their mouths sewn shut.</p>

                        <p>The @UUID[Actor.pu5qFuIUwnqKwNby]{Ultroloth} keeps the prisoners alive until they perish of natural causes. He is served by four @UUID[Actor.iL4PmEs9liKjvtkO]{mezzoloths} who watch the prisoners intently and occasionally torment them for their own amusement.</p>

                            <p>The vast majority of the prisoners here have had their mouths sewn shut. However, this is not the ultroloth's handiwork. Every year, Lutheria visits the island and tells jokes to the prisoners, making a note of those who do not laugh loudly enough. Then, she personally sews their mouths shut as punishment.</p>

                        <p>The most helpful prisoner on the island is a woman named Oresteia (NE @UUID[Actor.VLcv0KGejaHiR3Dk]{Mage}). Oresteia is one of very few prisoners who can speak, because she's wise enough to flatter the Lady of Dreams during her annual visits. Oresteia has two pieces of advice for the heroes:</p>
                        <ul class="rd__list">
                            <li class="rd__li ">Always laugh at Lutheria's jokes.</li>
                            <li class="rd__li ">Challenge Lutheria to the Royal Game.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Oresteia has earned preferential treatment from the Lady of Dreams for decades by following this advice. She keeps the Titan entertained by humoring her jokes and devising surprising new strategies for the Royal Game. Lutheria has even ordered the ultroloth to keep the mage in some measure of comfort, bringing her wine and stale bread from time to time.</p>
                        <p>Oresteia warns the heroes that Lutheria will always win the @UUID[Item.blW16crGWBVkQ1NY]{game of twenty squares}, because she's devised some way to cheat. The Titan loves winning almost as much as she hates losing. However, the magic she uses to cheat at the game also seems to drain her energy. The mage has never pushed her luck enough to try and win the game, but it's possible that Lutheria will be more vulnerable after a particularly rousing game.</p>

                    <p>Your vessel sails towards an island that seems strangely square-shaped. It soon becomes clear that the island is actually a gargantuan iron cube. Runes have been deeply etched into each of the faces you can see. The bottom face is level with the surface of the sea; the top face, some hundred feet above, hangs from five massive chains. The chains disappear into the fathomless heavens of the Nether Sea. A disturbing noise echoes from within the structure, alternating between a low rumble and a high whistle.</p>

                <p>A huge iron cube, 100 feet on each edge, hangs from five massive chains: four chains attach to the top corners of the cube, and the last attaches to the center of the cube's top face. The bottom of the cube just touches the water of the Nether Sea. There are runes inscribed into the iron cube, and these can be used as handholds if anyone tries to climb the walls. The top face of the iron cube is flat except for a small entryway in one corner (B1).</p>
                <p>The cube that hangs closest to Titan Island (N3) is the only cube that the heroes are able to gain access to. They must have learned the primordial word from the living Titan on that island in order to enter it.</p>

                    <p>A movement on the horizon breaks the gloomy monotony of the Nether Sea. A pair of immense shapes come into view: the first is the upper body of a colossal male humanoid wading through the waves. Rags obscure much of his face, but it is clear that his lips have been sealed shut. Scars cover his muscular body as he trudges slowly onward, gripping onto a great length of chain. He pulls a massive, impressive bronze barge. Lush green plants spill over the top of the barge—a verdant garden in a lifeless expanse of black ocean.</p>

                <p>This barge is <em>Hypnos</em>, the dwelling place of Lutheria.

He wades through the Nether Sea, eternally pulling Lutheria's barge.</p>
                <p>Lutheria's barge is a hanging garden that features lush plants, vines, and trees. Fantastical flowers grow in the garden, of almost every kind imaginable, and their perfume almost drowns out the acidic smell of the Nether Sea.

About two thirds of the sand inside is in the bottom half of the hourglass, while the rest pours slowly down.

The @UUID[Item.mk97LLr9MF2V6CPk]{legend lore} spell can also be used to reveal it.</p>
                    <p>The primordial word is pretty much unpronounceable by mortals. It will appear in a hero's mind, be used once to open the portal, and then vanish. The players don't actually need to know or speak the word. They only need to know that it exists in one hero's mind.</p>

                        <p>This must be some sort of breeding chamber for the worms. Two giant purple colored worms, more than thirty feet in length, are chained and entwined with one another in the center of the room. Featureless humanoid golems work on the worms, paying little attention to anything else in front of them.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>This is the breeding chamber for the tarrasque's food. Purple worms breed in a manner similar to earth worms. The two purple worms join together and pass genetic material to one another. This is stored in sacs and then a cocoon forms on the body of each worm, with each cocoon holding [[/r 1d6]] wormlings. Once these worm-filled cocoons are large enough, they are taken to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#b3.-chamber-of-worms]{Chamber of Worms} (B3) and emptied. The purple worms here can also be milked for their poison.</p>
                    <p>The two adult @UUID[Actor.bZ5VBd4QtfJyQiMK]{purple worms} in the room are restrained by adamantine chains. Three @UUID[Actor.YaYJMK8KhIpryuYH]{primordial golems} are currently collecting poison from one of the purple worms. They will, however, immediately stop work and attack any intruders. Even while restrained, the purple worms are not completely harmless. Anyone who comes within 10 feet of a worm's head will be the target of a <em>bite</em> attack. Anyone who comes within 10 feet of the other end of the worm will be targeted by a <em>stinger</em> attack. Treat these as readied actions. Note that the purple worms will not attack the golems.</p>

                        <p>In this room, the walls and floors are covered in a thick, mucous slime that almost seems alive. The floor is marked by strange engravings that look like a grid. On opposite sides of the room are levers on the walls: one lever is shaped like a worm, while the other is horn-shaped. A shapeless humanoid figure stands in the chamber next to the worm-shaped lever.</p>

The other lever, shaped like a horn, opens a trap door in the floor, which dumps the worms into the tarrasque's chamber below.</p>
                    <p>One primordial golem waits in the room. When the party reaches the room, the golem pulls the worm lever to dump a dozen @UUID[Actor.sEFpnOmi5BSWB9Mf]{purple wormlings} (same statistics as @UUID[Actor.tSxctB6ker7y083V]{giant poisonous snakes}) onto the floor. The golem then waits until someone enters the room. At this point, it will move to pull the other lever and open the trap door.

                        <p>This long hall has a strange floor. The floor appears to have dozens of small holes, each with an iron covering. At the far end of the hall, there is a circular metal door with a small lever located beside it.</p>

                    <p>This strange room is the mechanism for waking the tarrasque. When the tarrasque needs to be awakened, a primordial golem opens the circular door. When the circular door is opened, the entrance door slams shut and locks. This causes the hall to fill with purple worm venom in three rounds. The circular door automatically closes and locks after three rounds. All of the locks require a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using @UUID[Item.3uUg0fHZ48rdcNk8]{thieves' tools} to open. The lever beside the door can be used to open up the small holes in the floor. The poison drains through the holes onto the tarrasque below and awakens the gargantuan beast.</p>
                    <p>Anyone in the room when it is filling with poison will take [[/damage 1d6 type=poison]] damage per round. Anyone who drinks or breathes in the poison (for example, with @UUID[Item.1Q2EXjKWYlUbEbjf]{water breathing}) takes the full damage from @UUID[Item.QGcukYr7ZeO6zkLU]{purple worm poison} ([[/damage 12d6]]). Anyone with fewer than 75% of their hit points remaining takes full damage from the second round onwards, as the poison seeps into their wounds.</p>

                    <p>This room is where the caretaker of the prison, an @UUID[Actor.pu5qFuIUwnqKwNby]{Ultroloth}, can be found. Initially, he will not be hostile to the heroes. Instead, one of his @UUID[Actor.5YC5IujeTG9RbqLv]{bronze automatons} will be used as a mouthpiece to communicate with the heroes. The ultroloth is intelligent, and he understands why the heroes have broken into the prison. He seeks to be released from his bargain with Lutheria, so he is very open about his desire to assist the heroes.</p>
                    <p>He is willing to tell the heroes how to awaken the tarrasque but, in return, they must swear an oath to kill Lutheria and bring her crystal scythe back to him. This oath is a serious matter, and it will be enforced by the erinyes of the <em>Island of the Oathbreakers</em>. If the heroes are unwilling to swear the oath, then the ultroloth expresses his profound disappointment in them. He attacks with the help of his three @UUID[Actor.5YC5IujeTG9RbqLv]{bronze automatons}.</p>
                    <p>The strange goblets are filled with @UUID[Item.QGcukYr7ZeO6zkLU]{purple worm poison}. The ultroloth has acquired a taste for the substance, and he is resistant to its effects. He won't stop anyone from trying a drink for themselves, because he would find it amusing to watch. The bronze automatons are Sydon's gifts to him; the Titan wished to curry favor with the ultroloth in case he ever needed to use one of the weapons of the gods.</p>

                    <p>To open the cube, someone wearing the ultroloth's @UUID[Item.0JddjYVUjaDuOgxr]{talisman of the sphere} (B8) must control the @UUID[Item.FvDtbPzSttO1Rjr9]{sphere of annihilation} (B11) so that it sits at the very center of the room. The wearer of the talisman must then read aloud the texts from each sphere. This causes them to spin. Once all of the spheres are spinning, the bottom of the cube will open, hundreds of feet below. The tarrasque will be dumped into the Nether Sea, and the ancient beast will then make its way to the surface of Thylea and begin to wreak untold damage.</p>

            <p><em>Hypnos</em> is the domain of Lutheria, who is called the Lady of Dreams and the Mistress of Death. Her throne ship is a massive bronze ceremonial floating palace that is pulled across the Nether Sea by her ancient sibling, <strong>Talieus</strong> (LN @creature[Elder Empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords]). The enslaved Titan has been blinded and his mouth has been sewn shut. The only clean parts of his face are where tears have trickled down from his ruined eye sockets. He now trudges on, without rest or thanks, through the Nether Sea.</p>
            <p>Lutheria's barge is a hanging garden that features lush plants, vines, and trees. Fantastical flowers grow in the garden, of almost every kind imaginable, and their perfume almost drowns out the acidic smell of the Nether Sea. Lutheria spends much of her time in her garden.</p>
            <p>Beneath the garden is a network of tunnels and rooms inhabited by Lutheria's servants. These spaces are lined with tens of thousands of mortal skulls. Lutheria's servants include @UUID[Actor.SxwfXK3urk2SgydD]{lamias}. These half-woman/half-lion monstrosities are maenads that Lutheria has twisted into a more powerful form. The lamias are served by @UUID[Actor.tCJO5ktIzwoJwRjJ]{Jackalwere}, who were once male priests of Lutheria. Their loyalty has been rewarded by being summoned to the Lady's garden, where they are transformed into creatures who can serve her better.</p>

                <p>Events in <em>Hypnos</em> should have an otherworldly and dream-like quality. Ideally, the heroes should feel a kind of unease and distrust of everything that they experience in <em>Hypnos</em>. They should never be quite sure whether they are awake or in some sort of lucid dream or nightmare.</p>
                <p>Things in Lutheria's domain are not always quite what they seem. Her servants may behave in irrational, dreamlike ways. Distances between parts of the vessel need not always be consistent. For example, walking across the ship's deck may seem like an endless journey of days through a densely overgrown jungle.</p>

                    <p>The lamia has used @UUID[Item.tzcDDBpSDRMEZCqD]{disguise self}, and she looks like a beautiful woman. The lamia will greet intruders by kissing their hands. Anyone who allows this to happen comes under the lamia's <em>curse</em>, and for the next hour, they will have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.</p>
                    <p>The jackalwere are @UUID[Item.Vx5CqVLXOeZZQmdy]{polymorphed} into beautiful men and women, and are currently smoking pipes of <em>black lotus</em>. They invite anyone who enters the room to join them for a smoke. The jackalwere will try to wait until a majority of intruders have been cursed by the lamia. At this point, they will use their <em>sleep gaze</em> and claim that the party is drowsy from the effects of the lotus.</p>
                    <p>The jackalwere and lamia will defend themselves if attacked. If they are able to put the entire party to sleep, then they take them to @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#h8.-the-kitchens]{The Kitchens} (H8).</p>

                        <p>Underneath the lush greenery of the ship's deck, you find yourselves in a series of long, dark hallways. The walls and floor are lined with countless humanoid skulls. The skulls stare at you with dead eyes.</p>

                        <p>A doorway opens into a wide room lined with tall marble plinths, each displaying a unique object. Although many of the items are beautiful and unusual, some appear quite mundane. The nearest item is a writing quill with a brilliant orange plume that smolders like an ember. The next plinth supports a bright, silver-colored mask, depicting the face of an elven woman of unparalleled beauty.</p>
                        <p>Two small girls tend to this odd collection. One dusts an ivory box while the other polishes a simple platinum coin. The two girls possess unnaturally symmetrical features. They move with a feline grace.</p>

                    <p>This gallery hall is where Lutheria stores some of the magical trinkets that she has collected over the ages. She doesn't collect items for their power or utility, but rather because the items amuse her. All of the items rest on marble plinths:</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list">
                        <li class="rd__li "><em><strong>A carved ivory music box.</strong></em> When this is opened, a small turntable begins to move and the sounds of wailing and screaming fill the air. The box holds the souls of thousands of people from another world. Their rulers made a pact with Powers from the Nine Hells that their nation would rule the world for a thousand years. Aftewards, all the native souls would be the property of an archdevil. When the thousand years ended, the nation's most powerful wizards tried to protect the souls by binding them within the box, and the souls have remained there for millennia, without physical form and driven to madness.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li "><em><strong>An apple-sized dodecahedron</strong></em> forged from adamantine with strange, unreadable runes inscribed upon it. This is the only remaining object from a world that was swallowed by its sun.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li "><em><strong>A mithral mask</strong></em> of a beautiful elven woman. The wearer sees everything in the world in the most beautiful way imaginable, regardless of its reality.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li "><em><strong>A platinum coin</strong></em> with the head of a dragon stamped on one side and a dragon's tail on the other. The coin doesn't radiate any magical aura, but it can be attuned. Once attuned, the coin will always land on the face that its owner wishes when it is flipped.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li "><em><strong>A phoenix-feather writing quill.</strong></em> The quill was used to write the <em>Codex of the Infinite Planes</em>. Anyone writing with this quill always produces beautiful handwriting, and the writer can write in any language, even languages they cannot speak or understand.</li>

                    <p>Two @UUID[Actor.SxwfXK3urk2SgydD]{lamias} guard this room, but they appear to be young girls, and they claim to be sisters. They introduce trespassers to their "toys,"happily describing each item to those who are curious. They drag visitors to each plinth excitedly, but they warn against touching anything, because it makes Lutheria mad.</p>
                    <p>The lamia try to touch as many heroes as possible, holding their hands and pulling them around like excited children. Anyone who is touched by the lamia is affected by their <em>intoxicating touch</em> for 1 hour.</p>
                    <p>If any of the items are touched or taken, the two girls will begin to shriek. Any @UUID[Actor.tCJO5ktIzwoJwRjJ]{Jackalwere} below deck will come running and attack the intruders. When this happens, the lamia revert to their true forms and attack.</p>

                    <p>This room is used to break prisoners by bringing their worst nightmares to life. Anyone sitting in the chair activates the room's magic.

                        <p>This room appears to be an armory. It is guarded by four wild-eyed men who ignore your arrival, muttering incomprehensibly to themselves. Four items hang from skeletal hands that emerge from the walls: a greataxe, a greatsword, a shield, and a set of plate armor.</p>

                    <p>Four jackalwere guard this room, disguised as gibbering madmen. They leave intruders alone unless someone touches the weapons or armor on display. Whenever an item is touched, the jackalwere grow quiet and stare at whoever touched it, using <em>sleep gaze</em> to render the offender &Reference[condition=unconscious]. Anyone who has been touched by a lamia will have disadvantage on their saving throw.</p>

                        <p>The weapons and armor displayed in this room contain portions of Lutheria's ancient madness. Sydon once attempted to cure his sister's insanity by drawing it out like a poison. He forged this psychic energy into the magic items in this room. They are: @item[plate mail of vulnerability|DMG], @UUID[Item.wqy6DIYCy6SpI7mA]{berserker greataxe}, @UUID[Item.XGcU48SZQa0x9bCK]{shield of missile attraction}, and a @UUID[Item.O9NJTbK8RL0UsYCb]{greatsword of vengeance}.</p>
                        <p>Anyone touching one of these cursed items for the first time must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or contract a @UUID[RollTable.pG1sze9DSilZ3uaU]{short-term madness} (see <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#DMG,8,madness,0">Madness</a> in the 5th Edition <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#DMG">Game Master's Guide</a>).

                            <p>Lutheria has disadvantage on attack rolls versus characters who are wielding one of these items. If an attack from one of these weapons hits Lutheria, or if she hits someone wearing the armor with her scythe, then the cursed item is destroyed, and she is immediately overwhelmed by the ancient madness that was bound within the item. Whenever this happens, Lutheria suffers the effects of the @UUID[Item.umLxjNwjxFG2WBaG]{confusion} spell until the end of her next turn.</p>

                        <p>Two strange women sit in this room, with their backs to the door. Both women have the lower bodies of lions. Each of these creatures stares intently into a looking glass.

                    <p>The women are two @UUID[Actor.SxwfXK3urk2SgydD]{lamias}. They use the mirrors to watch all the lands of Thylea, and they make daily reports to Lutheria. They are proud of this task, and they are happy to explain it to the heroes.</p>
                    <p>The lamias attempt to touch the heroes during their explanation. They may try to show the heroes something disturbing, such as King Acastus plotting against them—or the massive fleet that Sydon has gathered. Once they have touched the heroes, the lamias summon all the remaining @UUID[Actor.tCJO5ktIzwoJwRjJ]{Jackalwere} on this deck and attack the party.</p>
                    <p>Each of the mirrors is attuned to a lamia, and they will not work when anyone else attempts to use them.</p>

To entertain herself, she throws bacchanals—parties of drunken excess—for her most devoted servants. Lutheria does not immediately attack those who trespass in her garden. She will first satisfy her curiosity and seek to entertain herself by telling jokes, playing games, and toying with her prey.</p>

                    <p>This courtyard is filled with goatlings and fey creatures engaged in drunken revelry. At the center of the crowd, a beautiful giant-sized woman lounges on an ornate throne. Most of the revelers are so intoxicated that they fail to notice your presence, but the black-eyed woman immediately locks eyes with you.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, the heroes of the prophecy. I suppose you have come to kill me. That would be very boring. Wouldn't you prefer to join the festivities?"</p>
                    <p>Despite the cup of wine in her hand, the woman's voice remains sober, but her eyes brim with madness.</p>

                    <p>The garden is filled with Lutheria's servants, all of whom are engaged in debauchery and drunken revelry. The participants include two @UUID[Actor.SxwfXK3urk2SgydD]{lamias}, two @UUID[Actor.QR79OGEZOnRI7VDv]{satyr minstrels}, and seven @UUID[Actor.XCfvQueH2aXzTSRG]{goatlings}. All but Lutheria are drunk (they have the &Reference[condition=poisoned] condition).</p>
                    <p>Lutheria's servants urge the heroes to join in the revelry, forcing drinks into their hands and trying to entice them with sensual words. But joining the revelry is, in effect, a death sentence by poisoning.</p>
                    <p>Heroes who drink the wine must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or else they become &Reference[condition=poisoned] and abandon their senses. While participating in the revelry, they take [[/damage 1d6 type=psychic]] damage each round. In order to regain control of themselves, the heroes must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.</p>
                    <p>Refusing to join in has no immediate consequences. Lutheria turns a withering gaze upon each person in the heroes' party, then tosses back her drink and ignores them. Your players should feel uneasy about their refusal to join—it's not wise to spoil Lutheria's fun.</p>
                    <p>Attacking Lutheria will cause all her servants to abandon their revelry and rush to her defense, even though they are drunk and effectively &Reference[condition=poisoned].</p>

                    <p>Lutheria deadpans the following jokes. With each joke, the entire entourage bursts into a chorus of laughter. Lutheria does not laugh. She watches the heroes intently, gauging their reaction.</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list">
                        <li class="rd__li ">

                    <p>It should be clear to your players that they are actually expected to laugh out loud at these jokes. If anyone refuses to laugh, Lutheria becomes irate. She points at each hero who failed to laugh and berates them.</p>

                        <p>Lutheria's points at you accusingly, and her eyes burn into the back of your skull. "You there. Why didn't you laugh? Are you bored? Am I boring to you? Answer me!"</p>

When she fails one of the opposed skill rolls, she may spend one of her uses of <em>legendary resistance</em> to automatically win the roll instead. All of Lutheria's rolls should be hidden behind the GM screen. Heroes with high passive Perception scores may notice her cheating, but the Furies are incapable of detecting it.</p>

                    <p>If the heroes provoke a battle with Lutheria, whether by attacking her or by annoying her too much, read the following:</p>
                    <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                        <p><span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p211</span></p>
                        <p>"You mortals always disappoint me."</p>
                        <p>The Lady of Dreams appears affected by a deep sadness. Black tears roll down her face. The garden wilts, and all of her servants begin to weep and wail. Minutes pass, and the mournful scene continues. You feel a chill run down your spine.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Lutheria ostentatiously dries her eyes. Her face breaks into a wicked smile. "Well. I need some cheering up. Let's start by tearing your pathetic little bodies apart, limb from limb."</p>
                        <div class="float-clear">
                            <p></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The heroes are immediately attacked by all of the creatures participating in the bacchanal. Lutheria joins the battle after one round, gleefully inflicting as much damage as she can with her scythe. She loudly orders her minions to torture and crucify the heroes.</p>
                    <p>This battle should be very difficult, and it should force the heroes to expend all of their resources. You might need to bring in reinforcements from elsewhere in <em>Hypnos</em> in order to increase the challenge. You may also choose to have Lutheria summon undead servants, such as @UUID[Actor.a5JuIb4TU3IZoNux]{wights} and @UUID[Actor.Bw2DtApIfm2JEHf6]{ghosts}, to assist in the battle.</p>

                        <p>If the Doomed One is present, Lutheria spends the first round in combat laughing uncontrollably at the lifetime of misfortune that she inflicted on them. If the Haunted One is present, Lutheria realizes that she's made a mistake and concentrates all her efforts on killing them.</p>
                        <p>The Haunted One needs to destroy Lutheria's scythe in order to release the souls of their lost family. Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#running-the-epic-paths]{Running the Epic Paths} section for details.</p>

                        <p>Lutheria collapses to her knees, grasping at the air in front of you. She unleashes a screeching wail of anguish, refusing to believe that a band of mere mortals has defeated her. Her body slowly transforms into a strange, twisting light. The light explodes into a storm of cosmic matter—and then she vanishes.</p>
