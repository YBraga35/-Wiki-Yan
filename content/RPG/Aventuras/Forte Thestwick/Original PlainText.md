BACKGROUND

The original soldiers stationed at Thestwick 

Watch were led by Sir Ranulf Nanbury, a 

decorated knight who served as the duke’s 

trusted advisor and protector. While many 

of the Alderham knights sent to the garrison 

were dismayed at the prospect of spending 

months or years in a fetid swamp, Sir Ranulf was 

instead honored to be defending the duchy to 

which he had pledged his life. The conflict with 

neighboring Talmouth remained a stalemate, 

but Sir Ranulf dutifully trained his troops, 

prepared for all varieties of attack, and remained 

ever-vigilant.

Of course, the supposedly “inevitable” conflict 

never resulted in bloodshed. Both sides backed 

off as diplomacy won the day. Sir Ranulf was 

torn. On the one hand, he was relieved that the 

duke and duchess could claim a political victory. 

On the other, he yearned for battle. He had spent so long preparing to fight. Was there really no glory to be claimed? Would Sir Ranulf return home and act as a mere bodyguard for the rest of his days?

After the peace treaty was signed, the duke sent word to Thestwick Watch that the Alderham knights were relieved of duty. They could return home for new assignments, or else claim land and title in the fen or the scant few unclaimed fields near the capital. Many, of course, chose to stay in Thestwick. In an unorthodox move, Sir Ranulf sent a letter to the duke claiming that he had secret intel revealing that Talmouth may not have conducted a full retreat of their troops. Sir Ranulf pledged himself to remain in Thestwick Watch until he could guarantee there would be no clandestine incursion. The duke was confused, but granted Sir Ranulf’s request. Sir Ranulf and his squire Kenric claimed Thestwick Watch for themselves. They roamed the now empty halls and scouted the endless expanse of fen beyond, keeping watch for invaders. In the back of his mind, Sir Ranulf knew there was no threat, but he was also certain that a return to the capital would be the death of his spirit. He needed to be out here on the frontlines, ready for combat, ready to defend Alderham Fen’s borders.
