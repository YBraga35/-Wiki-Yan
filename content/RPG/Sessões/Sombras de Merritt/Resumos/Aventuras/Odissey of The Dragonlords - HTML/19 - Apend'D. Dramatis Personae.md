            <p>The goddess Thylea has given her name to the Forgotten Land and has taken the form of a gargantuan tree at the heart of the sacred forest. Her followers believe that her roots reach deep into the earth, holding the world in her eternal embrace. Although she is a generous, life-giving goddess, she has been silent since the dawn of time, and as a consequence, very little is known about her.</p>
            <p>It is known that she created the land eons ago. She is the lost sister of some elder pantheon. Unlike her siblings, she wished to live apart from the mortal races and created Thylea as a refuge from civilization. It was to be a place where nature and fey magic could flourish, without the corrupting influences of mortal desires. Accordingly, she created her own pantheon of Titans, including the Twins, Sydon and Lutheria. Thylea granted Sydon dominion over the oceans and charged him with guarding the islands from any mortal intrusion. Lutheria was granted dominion over the forests, and she was charged with guarding the islands against other gods. Thylea, however, failed to anticipate the incredible burden that this would place on Lutheria's mind. Gods and demons from other worlds have attempted to probe the islands for thousands of years, and over time, this has driven Lutheria mad.</p>

        <p>The Five Gods were born when the powers of Sydon and Lutheria were stolen and infused into the bodies of five dragons who served the Dragonlords. The dragons surrendered their draconic forms and assumed new humanoid identities as lesser gods. Through the power of their pantheon, they can hear the prayers of their worshippers and grant them the power of magic.</p>
        <p>Mytros is the wellspring of their divine power. She ascended to true godhood when she sacrificed herself to forge the Oath of Peace. For the complete story, refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000025]{Secrets and Myths} appendix.</p>

            <p>Mytros is the most respected and renowned of the Five, and the namesake of the most important kingdom in Thylea. She is widely credited with the survival of "her"city during the destruction and immediate aftermath of the First War. She is said to appear to her priests as a warrior queen, clad in shimmering golden armor. However, she ascended to the heavens after the cataclysmic battle with Sydon and Lutheria, and she no longer walks among mortals. Mytros is the most powerful of the Five Gods, and the source of most priestly magic among the settler races in Thylea.</p>

                <p>Before coming to Thylea, Mytros was Balmytria, an ancient silver dragon. As Balmytria, she was responsible for creating the alliance between her dragon family and the mortal rulers who would become the Dragonlords. She chose to serve as the mount of Xander Huorath, the greatest of the Dragonlords. In her dragon form, Volkan was once her husband.</p>
