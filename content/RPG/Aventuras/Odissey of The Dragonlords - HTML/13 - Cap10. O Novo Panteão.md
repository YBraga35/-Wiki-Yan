        <p>This chapter marks the beginning of a new phase in the story. With the Titans defeated and the gods transformed, Thylea suffers from a power vacuum. Many divine portfolios—battle, music, wisdom, and more—must be filled by new gods, or else chaos will rule. The souls of the dead are adrift, and the storms and seas of Thylea no longer heed a master. Who will don these mantles of power and ascend to become the new pantheon?</p>

            <p>The next part of the adventure works best if there has been a break in the story after the <em>Battle of Mytros</em>. This break can last several months or even several years. During this time, the heroes have lived through an extended recovery period in the wake of their quest. Even if one or more of the Titans survived, they have been dormant in the time since the battle. Consequently, the citizens of Mytros have had time to regroup, and life in Thylea is just now returning to normal.</p>
            <p>At this point, the heroes are perhaps the most influential mortals in all of Thylea. Their time has been occupied with a number of important activities.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1515"><span class="entry-title-inner">Building Settlements</span></h3>
                <p>The devastation wrought by the Titans has left large sections of Mytros in ruins, and many people were without homes. The heroes inspired many of the refugees to set out into the world and build new homes. These refugees founded new settlements, and each new settlement chose one of the heroes as its patron.</p>
                <p>Each new settlement is named after its patron hero. For example, a hero named Tiberius might inspire the settlement of "Tiberia."Temples and shrines have been built in the hero's honor, and festivals are held to celebrate when the hero visits. This is a great opportunity to make maximum use of the @table[Table of Fame Rewards|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords].</p>
                <p>These new settlements can be located anywhere on the world map of Thylea, but there are a number of places that make the most geographical sense. Refer to the revised world map in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{Apokalypsis} chapter, which includes markers for seven new settlements.</p>

                    <p>You might choose to run several roleplaying sessions where players work through the aftermath of the <em>Battle of Mytros</em> and the founding of the new settlements.

                <p>The heroes are the leaders of a new organization of Dragonlords. As the leaders of such a prestigious order, they are entrusted as the new "peacekeepers of Thylea."They are expected to mediate when kingdoms threaten to go to war and strike against those who would do harm to the people of Thylea. In addition, they must create a legacy for the Order of Dragonlords that will stand the test of time. They must search for worthy new candidates to join the order and track down rare dragon eggs that can be raised as mounts for new recruits.</p>

            <p>The heroes receive a plea to help Narsus, the lost god of beauty. Narsus is the lost brother of Kyrah, Pythor, and Vallus. They rarely speak of him, because he is self-absorbed and selfish—obsessed with the incomparable beauty that he attained when he was transformed from a dragon into a god. Narsus refused to aid the settlers during the First War, and his family consequently disowned him.</p>
            <p>After the end of the First War, Narsus staged a competition to choose a woman worthy of being his wife. His suitors were to bring him the silver antlers of an elusive white stag. Many of the most powerful and influential women in the world participated in the contest, but the victor was an oread huntress named Ekoh. Tragically, she was never able to claim her prize. Queen Calliope of Aresia became obsessed with Narsus—she took him captive and fled back to her city.</p>
            <p>Narsus has been held in Aresia for 500 years, and the city of Mytros has launched many campaigns to recover the god of beauty without success. The two cities now have a long history of grievances which have eclipsed the original conflict. But with the return of the Dragonlords, Ekoh wishes to siege Aresia and take back her husband once and for all.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1525"><span class="entry-title-inner">Ekoh's Call to Arms</span></h2>
                <p>Ekoh meets with the heroes in Mytros and pleads her case. Knowing that the heroes are unlikely to start a war between Thylea's two greatest cities over such an ancient dispute, Ekoh tempts them with a more powerful incentive: her lost love has learned the path that mortals must walk to become gods.</p>
                <p>With the end of the Oath of Peace, Narsus returned to his dragon form. In the time that has passed, he has researched a means to reclaim the beautiful form that was lost to him. He now seeks to share these secrets with any mortals who come to his aid—anyone who rescues him from the clutches of the Aresian queen. Narsus proposes to create a new pantheon, with the heroes as his fellow gods and goddesses.</p>

            <p>The adventure begins when the heroes are brought together to hear the petition of a famous nymph named Ekoh. She claims to know the secrets of divinity and wishes to share the knowledge with the heroes. Each of the heroes receives the following letter:</p>

                <p>Ekoh (CN @UUID[Actor.pXd2Yp0k9e0h8bJm]{Oread}) meets the heroes in the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#m3.-the-theater-of-the-gods]{Theater of the Gods} in Mytros (M3). Ekoh has a curious verbal tic that causes her to repeat the last phrase of every sentence.</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                    <p><span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p249</span></p>
                    <p>You find a beautiful woman waiting to meet with you in the empty theater. "Thank you for answering my summons. <em>I am called Ekoh.</em>"</p>
                    <p>From her appearance, it's clear that she is an oread—a mountain nymph. Her skin is like polished obsidian, while her hair is like freshly-fallen snow. She stands tall and proud, with sharply defined features that give her a striking and commanding presence.</p>
                    <p>"Five hundred years ago, my betrothed—Narsus, the God of Beauty—was stolen away from me by the queen of Aresia. For half a millennium, her descendants have kept Narsus imprisoned in the dungeons of their foul city. Many wars have been fought to free him—but <em>the Aresian campaigns have amounted to nothing.</em>"</p>
                    <p>"Recently, my beloved Narsus learned of a secret ritual that transforms mortals into gods. He now seeks to build a new pantheon. Join with me to rescue him, and he will share the secrets with you. Moreover, we cannot let this knowledge fall into the hands of the Aresians—<em>think of the consequences!</em>"</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ekoh is vague on the details, she is absolutely confident that Narsus has the ability to elevate the heroes to true godhood. The 'divine path' is a well-studied concept at the Academy in Mytros, but it's mostly a collection of myths and legends. If such a ritual actually exists, then who better but a god to discover it?</p>
                <p>Ekoh presses the heroes to gather the armies of Mytros and Estoria to lay siege to Aresia so they can force Queen Helen to hand over her betrothed. She reminds them that Aresia is effectively a rogue kingdom that should be unified with Mytros by the authority of the Dragonlords. There are a sizable number of soldiers in the city who would gladly join a new campaign to settle the age-old rivalry between the two cities.</p>

                <p>After listening to Ekoh's proposal, the party will have much to discuss. If possible, they should consult with one of the Five Gods. Otherwise, they can consult with the Oracle—or Aesop from the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000005#e7.-the-dragon-shrine]{Dragon Shrine} (E7). Whoever they consult, read the following:</p>

                    <p>"What Ekoh says is true: Narsus is the God of Beauty, and he is a lost sibling of the Five. But there is much that she did not tell you."</p>
                    <p>"Narsus was self-absorbed, selfish, and obsessed with the beauty that he attained when he was transformed from a dragon into a god. In his vanity, he lost his way. He refused to aid the mortals during the First War. For this betrayal, the other gods disowned him. And when he was taken by Aresia, it was deemed justice."</p>
                    <p>"But if Narsus has truly learned the secrets of godhood, then we must take action. That much power is dangerous in the hands of a rival kingdom. You must rescue Narsus. You can attempt to infiltrate the city of Aresia on your own, or you can summon the strength of the armies of Mytros to aid you."</p>

                <p>Versi—or whoever advises the party—admits that Narsus is not clever enough to lie about knowing the secrets of godhood. And despite his vanity, he would almost certainly share his knowledge with whoever rescues him from captivity. Moreover, it is the duty of the Dragonlords to recover such knowledge.</p>
                <p>Queen Helen has no formal diplomatic relationship with Mytros, and she does not recognize the authority of the Dragonlords. The only way to treat with her directly would be through a show of force. Some advisors may believe that this is a chance to settle the age old rivalry between the cities of Aresia and Mytros—and to cement the Dragonlords as the new sovereigns of Thylea.</p>

                <p>In order to gather an army, the heroes can use any direct political power that they might have, especially if they are kings and queens. As Dragonlords, the heroes can call upon volunteers to join their cause. They might call in favors or promise great wealth. The age-old rivalry between Mytros and Aresia means that volunteers are plentiful. Feel free to roleplay this process—or simply ask your players to describe how they want to contribute in gathering the army.</p>

                        <p>Once the army is gathered, the party can launch up to one thousand ships from Mytros to lay siege to Aresia. Each ship costs 200 gp to outfit and carries 200 soldiers. The party will need at least 10,000 soldiers to siege the city (a minimum of 50 ships, which costs 10,000 gp). The costs can be defrayed by increasing taxes in the city of Mytros, but this will cost the entire party 1 point of Fame.</p>

                    <p>With thousands of soldiers under your command, you march on Aresia. In the face of your overwhelming numbers, the citizens of Aresia and its surrounding region flee en masse as your army approaches, seeking shelter behind the city's famous 100-foot-high walls.</p>
                    <p>Dispersing your troops through the woodlands that encircle the city, your set up massive blockades at every road and gate leading into it. You station soldiers and siege engines on the banks of the river to sink any ship that tries to run the blockade.</p>
                    <p>With every entrance and exit sealed off by your army, no one can get in or out. The city's walls bristle with soldiers. The Siege of Aresia has begun.</p>

                <p>The armies of the heroes are arrayed outside of Aresia's western gate. Aresia is protected from sieges by the power of an artifact called the Palladium, which makes a direct assault extremely dangerous. Every attempt to siege the city during the Aresian campaigns failed because of this artifact—not to mention the city's ancient protector: a bronze colossus.</p>

                    <p>The ground suddenly begins to shake at regular intervals, accompanied by the sound of massive footfalls. Flocks of birds flee in panic from the nearby forest as a gargantuan bronze warrior emerges from the canopy, looming over your war camp.</p>
                    <p>"Ho there! Come to hassle my little city, have you? Not on my watch! I am called Talos, and I am the guardian of this place. What is your business here?"</p>

                <p><strong>Talos</strong> is a sentient bronze @UUID[Actor.Dxo0376IYUbNqPQb]{colossus} (Intelligence 12) who has long protected Aresia. His origins are unknown, but he has patrolled the forests of the Aresian peninsula for thousands of years. He protects the city because it pleases him to do so—he is a gentle giant.</p>
                <p>Talos politely asks the party to withdraw their army and return to Mytros. He hates squishing mortals beneath his boots, and he'd rather not fight unless forced to. He strongly encourages the party to find a diplomatic solution. If the party agrees to try, then Talos happily sits down next to the war camp and waits for events to proceed peacefully.</p>

The warriors on the city walls will support Talos with volleys of javelins that target the heroes and their dragons. In the event that the colossus is destroyed, Volkan is capable of repairing him, but it's a very slow process.</p>

            <p>A direct assault on the city can be planned and executed in many different ways. Make sure that you are familiar with the City of Aresia section as the heroes plan their assault. If you want to make an assault easier to run, you can use the following two encounters as flashpoints that decide the outcome of the larger battle.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1545"><span class="entry-title-inner">Battle at the Gates</span></h2>
                <p>The heroes are at the forefront of the attack on the main gates, and they must face off against Aresia's most famous warriors. If the heroes win, then the gates are breached and their armies flood the western section of the city. If the heroes lose, then the gates hold and attacking army is demoralized. Failure would force the party to negotiate or use stealth.</p>
                <p>The defenders at the gate are Leandros, Halcyon, and Laertes (martial masters). They are the commanders of some of Aresia's greatest fighting forces (A2, A6, A7). They are supported by another three martial masters, twelve warrior monks, and three mages.</p>
                <p>The battle is easier if the heroes have stolen the Palladium or if they've allied with the surrounding centaur tribes (refer to Zakroth's Prison Fort). Without the Palladium, the mages are diverted from the battle as they try to keep the walls from crumbling. If the centaur tribes are helping, then they sweep away the warrior monks and the additional three martial masters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1546"><span class="entry-title-inner">Battle at the Bridge</span></h2>
                <p>Once the gates are breached, the heroes lead the armies through the street of Aresia toward the palace. To reach the palace, they must cross one of the bridges. This is where Aresia's last stand takes place. If the party wins this battle, then the city falls, Queen Helen is taken prisoner, and Narsus is freed. If the battle is lost, then the attacking army is routed.</p>
                <p>The defenders at the bridge are Taureus (@UUID[Actor.IrgCa51erGMzKlGL]{minotaur berserker}), General Niobe (@UUID[Actor.WKlDH3u8kCxF5quF]{gladiator}), and Hiero (@UUID[Actor.cW1mOTLOpYhPEfn0]{veteran}). They are perhaps the fiercest warriors in Aresia (A9, A10, A11). They are aided by twelve warrior monks and six martial masters. If the centaur tribes are helping the party with the assault, then they sweep away the warrior monks and the martial masters.</p>

                    <p>You gather at the massive western gate of the city, waiting for your audience with Queen Helen of Aresia. A small iron grate built into the massive wooden door eventually swings open—it forms a passageway just large enough for you to enter single file.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the gate, you are met by the queen, who is flanked on either side by three royal guards in splendid red capes. An additional phalanx of fifty soldiers stand a hundred yards away, watching the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>Queen Helen is shorter than you expected—small and delicate. But her bearing is one of confidence and her voice is authoritative as she addresses you.</p>
                    <p>"Thank you for agreeing to this parley. While I cannot allow Narsus to go free at this time, I will grant you leave to speak with him in person... but first, we have an urgent matter to attend to."</p>
                    <p>"The mad warlord, Zakroth, has somehow come into possession of one of the Divine Artifacts. Unless he is stopped, he will raise an army to rival the Titans—he could even become a god. Destroy him, and I will acknowledge your sovereignty as Dragonlords."</p>

                <p>Queen Helen explains that Zakroth has somehow unified dozens of centaur tribes into a single army—something that only Sydon could have done in days past. Zakroth's forces are already raiding settlements across the peninsula, wantonly slaughtering everyone.</p>
                <p>Queen Helen reveals that Zakroth has somehow come into possession of the Ambrosia: one of the Divine Artifacts. She knows that the artifact can be used to become a god, but she doesn't know the details. She also knows that Narsus desires an audience with the heroes, and that the Ambrosia is one of the items that he requires for his ritual. She wants to assist Narsus, as long as the heroes promise not to steal him away.</p>
                <p>Helen reveals that Zakroth can be found at a prison fort deep in the surrounding forest. She orders Pyrrha to guide the heroes to its location. The queen is true to her word, and if the heroes bring back the Ambrosia, she will immediately escort them to the Chamber of Beauty (A6) for an audience with Narsus.</p>

                <p>You make your way down into the underground levels of the Temple of the Shield. As you descend, you hear a beautiful, ethereal voice drifting from below.</p>
                <p>When you finally reach the bottom, you discover a massive chamber filled with mirrors of all shapes and sizes: hundreds of reflecting surfaces in ornate frames of gold and silver. The floor is layered with a rainbow of shimmering mosaics.</p>
                <p>In the center of the room, a bronze dragon is curled up on the floor, staring woefully into a large mirror. Seated beside him is a beautiful siren, who pets him gently and sings soft, mournful melodies.</p>
                <p>As you enter, the dragon lifts his head. Noticing you, he scrambles to his feet, eager and excited. He lifts his head and extends his wings, preening and posing.</p>
                <p>"Welcome to the Chamber of Beauty, my friends! I am called Narsus. We have much to discuss!"</p>
                <div class="float-clear">

            <p>Narsus behaves the same way no matter how the heroes manage to gain an audience—he's like a proud puppy, ignorant of all the death and destruction required to obtain this audience. Although he is initially depressed, he brightens noticeably at the party's arrival. He's heard stories of the heroes, and he is excited that they've come. But he has no real interest in being rescued.</p>
            <p>Narsus doesn't care about Aresia or Mytros. He likes Queen Helen, because she attends to his every need. He's mostly forgotten about Ekoh. Narsus really only cares about himself. He wants to become a god again, so that he can regain his legendary beauty. He can still polymorph into his human guise, but he's lost the divine luster that he once possessed.</p>
            <p>Narsus explains that he's spent the last few years communing with his mother, and he's discovered the secret to becoming a god. He will gladly help the heroes become gods too, if they will only assist him.</p>

            <p>The city of Aresia is the largest settlement in the Aresian peninsula. It's famed for its martial arts temples, impressive walls, and hanging gardens. Located in the midst of a dense forest of spruce trees, the city is accessible from the Cerulean Gulf via the Thrake river.</p>
            <p>The city's walls are the pride of its citizens. They reach 100 ft. in height, so that the ramparts overlook the forest canopy. The river cuts through the center of the city via a system of gates that can be raised and lowered. The gates are wide enough to accommodate one full-sized trireme at a time. Aresia does not have a navy, so there are rarely many ships within the city except for the traders who ferry goods between Aresia and Mytros.</p>
            <p>The city is home to the famed Aresian warrior monks, who wear red cloaks and bronze helmets, fighting with spears and shields. They have a centuries-long grudge against the armies of Mytros, with open warfare breaking out between the two cities every few decades.</p>
            <p>The most beautiful feature of the city is its hanging gardens. The gardens are watered by a system of channels that carry water from the Thrake river. At the top of the gardens is the palace where the queen lives. Centuries ago, the first queen of Aresia captured Narsus, the god of beauty, and her successors have held him prisoner there ever since.</p>

                <p>Aresian society is centered around the ruling queen, who also serves as high priestess of the Temple of Narsus. Aresian entertainment revolves around competitions between the city's martial monasteries.</p>

                    <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1557"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Queen of Aresia</span></h2>
                    <p>For the past 500 years, a queen has ruled Aresia. The Founding Queen was named Calliope, and she is famous for bringing Narsus to Aresia. She lured him here under false pretenses, but he has never truly been a prisoner, like the stories in Mytros suggest. Narsus is a lazy and vain god, so he isn't in any hurry to leave.</p>
                    <p>The current queen is Helen. She closely monitors the affairs of her palace and the Temple of Narsus, and she makes the final judgements concerning the city's future. However, she leaves most of the tiresome governing to her council of advisors. There was only ever one King of Aresia—Karpathos, the father of Calliope. His history was carefully buried. From Calliope's reign onward, there was never another male monarch. The queens take male consorts, but no queen would suffer a king to be revered above Narsus.</p>

                    <p>The palace is full of the Queen's Guards, a legion of 100 warrior monks who are hand-selected by the queen. While they wear cloaks in the traditional Aresian crimson, the Queen's Guard cloaks are made of rich velvet, trimmed in shimmering gold. By order of the queen, all of the guards are male.</p>
                    <p>While they are formidable fighters, rumor has it that the queen prioritizes their physical beauty over their skills in combat. Each guard must swear an oath of loyalty, and they are not allowed to marry or have romantic relationships, under penalty of death. They serve for ten years, and they are recruited at the age of 17.</p>
                    <p>The Queen's Guards are headquartered in the barracks— two long houses in the northeastern corner of the palace grounds. In keeping with the Aresian culture, which prizes austerity, the most senior guards are stationed in the sparsely-decorated underground rooms. The junior members reside on the lavishly-decorated upper floors, giving them expansive views of the guards' training grounds and surrounding gardens.</p>

                        <p>The oldest member of the Queen's Guards, Leandros (LN martial master), is nearly 20 years older than the men under his command. He is not particularly handsome—in fact, there is a long scar running from his eyebrow to his jaw. Leandros has never lost a tournament match, though he no longer formally competes. He has served the queen faithfully for over two decades. It is widely speculated that he bears an unrequited love for the queen, for no one else has ever demonstrated such extraordinary patience with her capricious demands.</p>

                <p>Aresia was founded before the First War. There is a long history of tension between Mytros and Aresia.</p>

                    <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1563"><span class="entry-title-inner">Royal House History</span></h2>
                    <p>The royal house of Aresia was founded by King Karpathos and Queen Nemosyne, five hundred years ago. Together, they swore an oath to fight for Lutheria in the First War. However, they failed to appear when she needed them most, and she named them oathbreakers. As punishment, Lutheria cursed the king and queen to undeath, transforming them into vampires.</p>
                    <p>The entire royal family was consumed by the curse, with the exception of one daughter, named Calliope. Karpathos and his wife made their lair in a tomb near Aresia, hunting by night and preying on the people of the city. Calliope rallied her warriors and trapped her parents and their vampire spawn in the tomb.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Calliope took the mantle of queen and sought peace with Mytros to atone for her parents' treachery. But then, during one of her diplomatic visits, she became enamored with Narsus and absconded with him, causing a permanent rift between the two cities.</p>

                    <p>In the past 500 years, there have been at least twelve wars between Aresia and Mytros. This number varies depending on which historian one consults: each city claims victory in at least seven of the wars. The Aresians frequently boast that no siege has ever successfully breached their walls—and this is true, but they have often been crushed on the battlefield by the phalanxes of Mytros. On the other hand, Mytros boasts that their armies are unstoppable on the battlefield—but the warrior monks of Aresia have repeatedly razed entire districts of Mytros to the ground.</p>
                    <p>In spite of this long-standing rivalry, the two cities depend on trade with one another, and fleets of merchant ships regularly carry goods from one city to the other, even during times of war.</p>

                    <p>Narsus is revered by the city as the God of Beauty. He is egotistical, lazy, and arrogant. Long ago, he abandoned his siblings and sought an easy life among mortals. Almost every woman he met wanted to marry him, so he decided to make a game out of it. He proposed a contest to kill a white stag, offering his hand to whoever succeeded at the seemingly-impossible task.</p>
                    <p>Most contenders gave up the hunt after the first year, but the oread huntress, Ekoh, was obsessed with Narsus. She spent years searching for the stag and finally killed it. Triumphant, she returned to Mytros to claim the god's hand in marriage —but she was too late.</p>
                    <p>Queen Calliope of Aresia had seduced Narsus, luring him away to Aresia, where he's been kept ever since.</p>
                    <p>Ekoh is furious that Calliope violated the rules of the contest, and she has been trying for centuries to reclaim him. This is why Narsus must be kept hidden—and why the walls of Aresia grew to 100 feet in height.</p>
                    <p>Calliope established the Temple of Narsus to attend to his every need, knowing that he would be too lazy to leave. Calliope tricked Ekoh into cutting her hair during the hunt, and her priestesses use this lock of this hair for scrying spells, so that they can watch her from afar and prevent her from assassinating the queen.</p>

                        <p>Located on a hill resting just below the palace, these gardens spill over a huge, terraced green space. You can hear the calls of peacocks from halfway across the city. The garden offers a tranquil space for meditation. The gentle sound of rushing water rises from irrigation canals that are carefully hidden throughout the garden.</p>

This is a rule long enforced by the nobility, who wish for a quiet place to gather and gossip. Diocletes stands a full head above his team, and the queen often admires him from her palace balcony on clear days.</p>

                        <p>The Queen's Palace sits at the highest point in Aresia, overlooking the hanging gardens. The architecture is elegant and free of ornamentation. Beautiful green ivy climbs up the white limestone walls. The top floors are open-air passages, where you can often see flickers of crimson cloaks, as royal guards patrol the palace.</p>

                    <p>The grounds include several buildings: the main palace, the bathhouse, and the surrounding guard towers. Near the rear of the grounds are the guards' barracks and the servants' quarters. The barracks house the queen's legion of royal guards (warrior monks), who wear distinctive crimson velvet cloaks trimmed in gold.</p>
                    <p>Queen Helen (NG noble) serves as ruler of the city and high priestess of the Temple of Narsus. She can be found in her throne room during formal functions, and her personal chambers when off-duty. The queen is never seen in public without an entourage of her young, handsome guards. She is in love with Narsus, who hasn't made a public appearance in decades. In spite of this, the queen takes many lovers, often her own guards and servants, though she tires of them quickly and never lets any of them sleep in her bed. The queen is often the only woman in the palace. She surrounds herself with handsome men, hoping to make Narsus jealous.</p>
                    <p>Leandros (LN martial master) is the commander of the royal guard. He is usually found beside the queen at formal functions or keeping a watchful eye on the guards at the training yard. Due to a series of recent break-ins at the palace, he's looking for someone to help him investigate. Nothing has been stolen—yet.</p>
                    <p>If the party investigates, they discover that acolytes from the Temple of the Shadow (A8) have been sneaking into the palace through secret tunnels at night. They are seeking some way to steal the Palladium.</p>

                            <p>This marble chamber in the basement of the palace houses a small golden orb that rests on a velvet pillow. The room is guarded by twenty crimson-cloaked warriors. The room is lit by seven oil lamps.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The treasury houses a magical artifact called the Palladium. So long as it is housed within the palace, all siege weapons defending the city have advantage on attacks, and the walls of the city have resistance to damage. This artifact is the reason why the armies of Mytros have never breached the walls of Aresia.</p>

                            <p>This ghost appears only at night. He once served under the ancient king, Karpathos, but has forgotten his own name. He refers to the heroes as "Warriors from Mytros"and offers them the chance to dethrone the queen. He wants the party to escort Karpathos into the palace through the secret tunnels at night and restore him to the throne. He claims that his master is generous and will reward them handsomely.</p>

                    <p>This temple is full of mirrors, and it has ceilings covered in gold leaf. Despite its name, Narsus rarely comes here. The temple primarily serves as a convent for his priestesses. The priestesses of the temple (LG acolytes) are selected at age 12 for their loyalty to the queen, and they serve for twelve years, retiring at the age of 24. They wear silky gowns and scarves wrapped to conceal everything except their eyes—the queen brooks no competition for the affection of the God of Beauty.</p>
                    <p>The people of Aresia believe that Narsus loves their city and blesses them with his presence. Accordingly, the servants attend to his every need, day and night.</p>

                                <p>The most popular and competitive event by far, armed combat is dominated by warriors from the Temple of the Shield. Most events showcase their expertise in the shield-and-spear techniques. Tournament regulations require spears and other weapons to be blunted to minimize injuries, but events are often bloody regardless. There are also champions from other disciplines, including the Temple of the Sword. Warriors from the Temple of Tranquility are famous for taking down armed opponents with simple weapons, such as slings.</p>

                    <p>As the strictest of the Aresian temples, discipline here is a top priority. In order to maintain the image of the temple, those perceived as soft and slovenly are routinely culled, no matter how impressive their past achievements may be. The temple's proximity to the queen is a symbol of its importance, as their warriors guard the chamber of Narsus himself, located deep within the hill beneath their temple.</p>

Reaching the temple requires a strenuous hike, but the master here claims that this long walk facilitates contemplation. Younger monks who train at this temple are expected to spend years gathering olives before they are taught any martial techniques. There is a joke among the younger monks that the real lesson of the school is patience, as the master only seems to train those who have turned gray and wrinkled with age.

                        <p>Laertes famously subsists on a single olive per day, and most of his day is an elaborately-constructed ritual around this single olive. Most of the monks-in-training spend hours walking across the city to the enchanted olive grove, where they pick a single ripe olive at dusk. They must then walk all the way back to present their olives before Laertes, who goes through a lengthy ritual to select a single olive to eat. Laertes rarely speaks, but the monks closest to him believe that he is on the quest to find the perfect olive, and he refuses to die until he's enjoyed it. Many aspiring monks leave the school in frustration, but veteran students profess the wisdom of Laertes: that patience is the key to enlightenment.</p>

Jocasta will meet with the heroes and try to strike a deal. She knows where they can find Narsus, but in exchange for that information, she would like them to help her kill the Queen.</p>

                    <p>This temple teaches the monastic tradition called the Way of the Four Elements. They focus on elemental techniques to control air, water, earth, and fire. Unlike the other temples, the students here are less combat focused and instead help with the marketplace and city maintenance. Water and earth specialists help ensure that the marketplace runs smoothly, and assist with stocking and boat traffic. Many of the monks are tasked with management of the city's vital utilities, including the aqueducts, the masonry, lighting and dousing the torches, and more. While elemental monks are not highly respected as warriors in Aresia, they are seen as vital to the city's day-to-day operations.</p>

When the chimes grow quiet, it usually signals the calm before a storm.</p>

The horn was gifted to the city by Sydon, and it is held in place by a large statue of the storm titan. Sailors often visit this statue to pay their respects before setting out on long voyages.</p>

They follow the stoic philosophy of showing humility before the gods, focusing on doing good work—and most importantly, not complaining or asking for more. While the shield monks enforce discipline with an iron hand, sword monks are expected to develop it naturally. The masters only draw their sword when they intend to cut the enemy.</p>

                <p>There are four centaur hostages kept in the fort. They are the sons and daughters of the chieftains of the strongest centaur tribes.

                    <p>The central stair is guarded by Murgrat (gigantes). Murgrat is young and more curious than most of his kind. He greets the party and asks their names. Then he proudly explains that he is one of Zakroth's warriors, and Zakroth is "Hergeron's Chosen."He and his brothers and sisters plan to eat all the mortals in Thylea, and then Hergeron the Titan will be resurrected so that he can put the finishing touches on the gigantes race. As Murgrat explains all of this, he draws closer to the party, and his poisonous saliva splashes onto the floor. Eventually, he attacks the party and tries to eat them.</p>

                <p>When the heroes leave the prison fort, they are confronted by a band of centaurs led by Chieftan Agrius (NG centaur lord). Agrius is accompanied by four centaur heroes and six additional centaurs. He sent his daughter Lesia to try and negotiate for the release of his son, Perimedes. If Lesia managed to escape the fort, then she is here with her father.</p>
                <p>Agrius starts by investigating the situation and sending scouts into the fort. The encounter with Agrius can unfold in several different ways, depending on how the heroes have treated the hostages.</p>

            <p>This is the tomb of Karpathos, the first and only king of Aresia. Five centuries ago, Karpathos broke an oath to Lutheria. As punishment, the Mistress of Death transformed him into a vampire. Karpathos feasted on the blood of his queen, Nemosyne, and almost all of his sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers.</p>
            <p>Karpathos and his brood were the scourge of Aresia for many years until Princess Calliope, his lone surviving daughter, led a band of Aresia's bravest warriors to the vampire tombs and sealed them up while they slept during the day. Powerful wizards and clerics cast magical wards to make sure that no one would be able to release the undead from their imprisonment. For five hundred years, the tombs have been forbidden to all and guarded by elite Aresian warriors.</p>

                <p>There are two full vampires in the tombs. One is the former king, Karpathos the Wolf Lord, while the other is the former Queen Nemosyne. Nemosyne and all of the vampire spawn in the tomb were created by Karpathos; they exist to serve and protect him. Unlike a normal vampire, Karpathos cannot create vampire spawn just by draining their blood. Instead, after draining them, he must use the power of the Caduceus.</p>

                <p>The Caduceus is a powerful magical staff that was buried with Karpathos. It is one of the Divine Artifacts. Karpathos used the power of the Caduceus to transform his victims into vampires. The staff is seemingly indestructible. It was buried with the vampire so that no one else could make use of its foul magic.</p>
                <p>Narsus knows the truth—the staff is imbued with the life force of one of the ancient Titans. It is not cursed, but its power of life-giving is perverted when used by undead creatures. For more information on the Caduceus refer to the Treasures appendix.</p>

In addition, any celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend that enters the tombs for the first time takes 5d10 necrotic damage. Elves, satyrs, and other creatures with fey ancestry take half of this damage.</p>
                <p>In addition, the door that leads into the tombs is protected by a permanent antipathy/sympathy spell that makes it difficult to approach. Refer to K1 for details.</p>

                <p>The barrows are protected by an elite contingent of twelve Aresian warrior monks led by Yosfor (TN martial master). Yosfor and his band are part of a long line of warriors charged with guarding this tomb. At night, they make camp several hundred feet away from the tomb, because the noises from inside are too disturbing.</p>
                <p>Yosfor stops anyone who approaches the tomb and demands that they identify themselves. He and his band will prevent unauthorized entry by force if necessary. He can be persuaded to stand down with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the heroes have a letter from Queen Helen, then they are allowed entry.</p>

                        <p>Ten minutes after the entrance of the tomb has been unsealed, a pack of four nuckle will enter. These horrifying creatures emerged from the ocean months ago and have haunted the edges of the barrows, waiting for an opportunity to enter the tombs.

The vampire spawn gather in the Main Antechamber (K4) and wait to ambush anyone who passes through. This is the order in which they explore the tomb:</p>

Once a nuckle has managed to successfully grapple a hero, it will use its full move to return to the Main Antechamber (K4). It takes two rounds for the nuckle to deposit its victim in this room full of vampire spawn before returning to rejoin the battle.

If they fail that saving throw, they cannot make another until 24 hours have passed. Those who make their saving throw are immune to the effects for a full minute.</p>

                            <p>If Karpathos is losing the battle, he will try to find Queen Nemosyne. He uses misty escape to flee to the Sepulcher of Nemosyne (K14), slipping through any sealed doors along the way. Once he finds his queen, he will free her and then all of the vampire spawn in the Chamber of Children (K12). The entire family of vampires then seeks out the party and attempts to ambush them.</p>
