            <p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">“<em>The Forgotten Sea comprises thousands of miles of ocean churned by storms, whirlpools, and elemental magic. The waters are home to massive creatures, cyclopean ruins, and the tower of the ocean god himself. You cannot conquer the Forgotten Sea—you can only survive it.</em>”</p>

        </div>
        <p>The Forgotten Sea is the endless expanse of ocean that stretches beyond the Cerulean Gulf. This is the indisputable domain of Sydon, the Lord of Storms. The sailors of Mytros and Aresia know better than to cross through the narrow straits of the Barrier Islands, because the Titan does not suffer trespassers to live. Death awaits any mortal who ventures into the territory of the ocean god.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of islands in the Forgotten Sea. This chapter details those that are most significant to the story of this book, but just about any adventure set on a remote island could take place here. Feel free to include encounters that would be unusual in the rest of Thylea. Sydon may have recruited powerful outside forces into his armies—or perhaps his storms have simply shipwrecked them here.</p>

            <p>The party's primary goal in the Forgotten Sea is to find and confront the Titans. Sydon can be found in his tower at @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000009#praxys,-tower-of-sydon]{Praxys}, but Kyrah recommends confronting Lutheria first. Both Titans are extremely dangerous, but Sydon is protected by an entire army.</p>
            <p>Lutheria can be found by seeking out an entrance to the Nether Sea, but Kyrah doesn't know where to find one. The party should eventually stumble into the massive whirlpool, @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000009#charybdis,-the-ravening-mouth]{Charybdis}, which will take them there.</p>

            <p>Sailing the Forgotten Sea should feel more dangerous than the Cerulean Gulf. Storms and encounters are more frequent here, and the ocean is always rough, pushing the crew of the <em>Ultros</em> to its limits.</p>

                <p>As you sail into the Forgotten Sea, dark storm clouds spread across the horizon and powerful waves crash against the hull of your ship. Saltwater frequently rains down upon the deck, drenching the crew. You suddenly realize that sailing through these angry waters will someday be counted among your many Great Labors.</p>

                <p>Your ship approaches an island dominated by a single massive mountain surrounded by steep cliffs. The island is ringed by coral reefs and jagged rocks. Any attempts to navigate a large ship near this island's rocky shores are likely to end in disaster.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This mountainous island soars 500 ft. into the air, has no natural bays, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs and rocky shallows. Approaching the island requires the use of a rowboat. Navigating the rocks and reefs in the rowboat requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Magical transportation would also work.</p>
            <p>The craggy island is the nesting place for a mated pair of @UUID[Actor.Nbm90ZIIME9EFdhm]{rocs} who have produced a clutch of young—a once per decade event. The rocs have been hunting aggressively to feed their voracious young. Normally, rocs have enormous, world-spanning hunting grounds, but this pair have confined themselves to the waters around Thylea, in order to remain close to their nest. The rocs are protective of their nest, making them more aggressive than they would typically be.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
                <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                    <p>There are no easy paths up to the rocs' nest. Climbing requires three successful DC 18 Strength (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) checks. The party can make the climb easier by using @UUID[Item.PVzqwoSwrUltLAtL]{ropes} and @UUID[Item.xOOkKdhCFiykCpKW]{pitons}. Falling from any height results in 30 ([[/damage 10d6 type=bludgeoning]]) damage.</p>
                    <p>Other flying scavengers nest on the lower parts of the island, eating whatever scraps that the rocs leave behind. Amongst these scavengers are a half dozen @UUID[Actor.LWJzgWUZLMDohaQU]{perytons} nesting in a cave half way up the cliffs. The perytons are hungry and thus very aggressive.</p>

                    <p>This massive nest is constructed from splintered tree trunks and ship masts. The nest is splattered with heaps of bird droppings, some of which seem to hide salvage from destroyed ships. Six towering fledglings with hooked beaks gaze at you hungrily.</p>

                <p>Six fledgling rocs (use @UUID[Actor.teTUyjWrqJ9escT8]{Giant Vulture} statistics) live in the nest. They won't leave the nest, but they will attack anything that comes within pecking distance. Whenever they reduce a target to zero hit points, they tear it apart and devour it hungrily.</p>

                    <p>Amid the droppings of the fledgling rocs are spoils from the wreckage of many Thylean ships. Each hour spent searching the nest turns up random treasure. Roll once on the @UUID[RollTable.undefined]{CR 5-10 treasure hoard table} in the 5th Edition <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#DMG">Game Master's Guide</a> for each hour. After three hours of searching, everything has been discovered.</p>
                    <p>For each hour that the heroes spend searching, there is a 20% cumulative chance of the two adult rocs returning to the nest ([[/r 1d100]]{20%} in the first hour, [[/r 1d100]]{40%} in the second, [[/r 1d100]]{60%} in the third).</p>

                <p>The island ahead is completely shrouded in fog. When you sail close enough to properly see through this haze, you find that rocky cliffs have formed a natural plateau, elevating the island's landscape far above the water. You can see shrubs and other plants spilling over the top of the cliffs, and you hear the strange, trumpeting calls of exotic beasts from farther inland.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">

            <p>This island is surrounded by enormous cliffs and perpetually surrounded by clouds and mist. There are a couple of anchorages, but anyone landing faces a long climb up to the island's plateau-like top.</p>
            <p>Most of the island consists of shrubs and grasslands, but there is a sizeable forest in the center. A cyclops clan has lived here for many centuries, and around 100 of the giants still live on the island. There are 80 male and female adults with 20 young (use ogre statistics for the young cyclopes). The cyclopes spend their lives raising large herds of @UUID[Actor.QfZWxK5Nwxpzyrsf]{elephants} as cattle.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
                <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1142"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Sun God</span></h2>
                <p>The island is ruled by a radiant, golden-haired man named <strong>Helios</strong> (NE polymorphed @UUID[Actor.lM5zKMg8lAKRGeXR]{Adult Gold Dragon}), hence its name. He claims to be the sun god who was once revered by all the mortal and giant races of Thylea, long before the coming of the Dragonlords.</p>
                <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1143"><span class="entry-title-inner">False God</span></h3>
                    <p>It's true that Helios was once revered as a sun god, but he never possessed any true divine power. He is merely a dragon who masquerades as a god by dazzling his worshippers with his polymorphed form.</p>
                    <p>Helios came here as a wyrmling 600 years ago, blown off course while flying between continents. He makes infrequent visits to mainland Thylea, mostly to check on various ancient shrines that were constructed to honor him, centuries ago. He is still revered by many small tribes of native creatures, including cyclopes, nymphs, centaurs, and satyrs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1144"><span class="entry-title-inner">Paranoid Dragon</span></h3>
                    <p>Helios is suspicious of anyone who comes to his island. Sydon warned him long ago that Thyleans would send heroes to kill and flay him for his beautiful golden skin. There is, indeed, an almost forgotten legend that the skin of "the Sun God"grants immortality to any who wear it, and one of the <em>Ultros'</em> crew will mention it if Helios is discussed when the heroes are aboard.</p>
                    <p>In spite of his understandably suspicious nature, Helios is always pleased by the prospect of visitors. The company of cyclopes leaves much to be desired as they are crude, often violent folk. Helios also seeks knowledge about current events in Thylea. He will not reveal his dragon form to visitors until he has decided whether or not to devour them, or they directly attack him. The heroes will be on the menu if he decides they represent a threat to his domain, or to Sydon.</p>

                <p>Centuries ago, Helios swore an @reward[Oath of Service|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|oath of service] to Sydon in order to protect his island. He has been training his cyclopes to wear armor and to wield mauls, in preparation for the Titan's forthcoming battle against the mortals of Thylea. However, Helios cares for his cyclopes as if they were his children, and he dislikes the idea of sending them to war.</p>

                        <p>The cyclopes live in ancient stone buildings that were built by the gygans a thousand years ago. The buildings are now partial ruins, as the cyclopes have not taken care of them. The creatures live simple, but contented, lives tending to their herds and competing in games of strength.</p>

                        <p>When he's not training the cyclopes, Helios spends his time on a small island just off the coast of the main island. It is forested and rather beautiful. He lives in a shallow lake at the center.</p>

An elderly cyclops with a milky white eye sets out plates of enormous cuts of roasted meat on the ornate dining table before you. Your host stands at the opposite end of the table.</p>
                    <p>Helios is an incredibly handsome man, made more splendid by radiant jewelry and skin that nearly glows with divine vigor. Sunlight glints from his golden hair, which matches the burnished color of his eyes.</p>

            <p>This island has several lagoons that make excellent harbors, as well as beautiful inlets where a ship can be beached. It is easy to make landing at almost any spot on the island's coastline.</p>
            <p><strong>Hexia</strong>, an @UUID[Actor.HH8zFszsgn21SZCP]{Adult Green Dragon}, lives here. Her foul influence has leached into the landscape, causing the jungles to grow unnaturally thick with trees, vines, and underbrush. After landing at the beach, it's difficult to move through the interior of the island.</p>
            <p>All of the animal life on the island, large and small, act as Hexia's eyes and ears. Like a jealous goddess, she is aware of everything that happens on her island, which serves as her personal hunting ground. She eats the deer and boar that thrive in the jungles, but each month on the full moon, she goes hunting for sweeter meat.</p>

                <p>Hexia has lived in Thylea for over five centuries. She is the adopted sister of Kyrah, Pythor, and Vallus, and was raised by the dragons Volkan and Balmytria. Hexia's mother, an ancient green, had been terrorizing some long-forgotten country in the Old World, and the Dragonlords slew her. Volkan took her under his wing, quite literally.</p>
                <p>Hexia always sought Pythor's affections, and the two of them were eventually married. It did not work out. She never forgave him for giving up his dragon form when he became the God of Battle. She became intensely jealous of his many consorts, seeing them as rivals for the love that should rightly be hers.</p>
                <p>This bitterness has eaten away all the goodness that Hexia's adoptive parents instilled in her. She is evil now, and utterly without mercy. She has taken revenge upon numerous mortal men and women who have been Pythor's consorts over the last several centuries.</p>

                <p>The island is stocked with elves—Hexia's favorite prey. Several hundred elves live on the island, forced to live like savages under constant threat of death. Whenever they try to build homes or anything else, like a ship or raft, Hexia arrives and tears it apart.</p>
                <p>The few times the elves have managed to launch an escape, Hexia has brought them back to the island, always making sure to eat an escapee or two to maintain her reign of terror. Causing fear and dread is part of her regular hunting pattern, as she harries the elves during the night before finally devouring one. Eating elves isn't enough to keep Hexia properly fed, of course; she does it because she loves to torment them.</p>
                <p>The tribes consists of several hundred elves (CG @UUID[Actor.F7PDqAcGfGGSO20J]{tribal warriors}) along with several dozen children.

                <p>Eventually, the elven leaders resolve that the heroes have been sent by the gods. They interpret the party's arrival as a sign that the dragon must be confronted, once and for all. Their situation is desperate, and they have lived in fear for too long.</p>
                <p>The elves ask the party to join them in seeking out Hexia's lair at the center of the island. If Hexia can be defeated, then the heroes are welcome to the dragon's treasure hoard—the elves have no use for it. Two of the Aresians will remain behind to defend the tribe.</p>

                <p>Hexia is not the only powerful creature that lairs on the island. The following encounter is entirely optional and is a challenge beyond the power of most heroes. Whether the elves or Hexia have discovered the existence of the Kraken is entirely up to you.</p>

                    <p>Standing on this sandy pink beach, you notice a jagged rock formation, not far from shore. A strange symbol has been carved into the rock facing the main island. It looks like a bulbous creature with eight snake-like arms.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The jagged rock island is several hundred feet from shore. This is actually the tip of an underwater mountain that is the lair of the @UUID[Actor.fqRdQAcUkcnMMqcg]{Kraken}, perhaps the single most dangerous creature in all of Thylea.</p>
                <p>The Kraken serves only itself. It is the enemy of every other living creature in Thylea, including the Titans. It bears a strong hatred for Sydon, who has foiled many of its schemes to wrest away control of the oceans.</p>
                <p>The Kraken spends about a fifth of its time in its lair and the rest of its time Traveling. It roams the oceans around Thylea and travels to other planes of existence using a @UUID[Item.L0vrdmVxmNXZmcTK]{cubic gate}. This means that there is a [[/r 1d100]]{20%} chance that the Kraken will be home when the heroes visit.</p>

                <p>The sea grows rough as a massive volcanic island comes into view. Its central peak belches thick black smoke and white-hot lava. Although you can see black sand beaches on the shore, choppy waters and the ring of jagged rocks protruding from the sea make a safe landfall challenging.</p>

            <p>The waters around this island are always rough. There are a couple of black, sandy beaches where landings can be made, but navigating through the rocks that surround the island requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure, the ship takes 250 damage to its hull that must be repaired.</p>
            <p>This island is called Typhon, but it has several other names: the "Island of Horror,"the "Island of the Maw,"and the "Father of Monsters."At the center of the island is a scar in the fabric of reality, a gaping pit that connects the mortal world to the plane of Hades. Legend has it that many of the warped monstrosities that haunt the world came from here—hence its name.</p>
            <p>Throughout history, many individuals have come here seeking power, but no one leaves the island without being twisted in some unexpected way. Terrible creatures such as the chimera and the manticore are thought to have first spawned upon this island.</p>
            <p>The island is an active volcano that towers nearly a mile into the sky, with flaming rivers of molten rocks running down the sides and boiling into the ocean. There is no easy way up its slopes, but for those willing to make the journey, there are three different cave entrances that lead into the Maw.</p>

                <p>The arcanaloth doesn't attack immediately. It calls itself "Hunger,"and it demands food from the party. It will allow a hero to pass through its cave into the Maw if given a proper sacrifice of food. Livestock totaling 500 pounds or more will satisfy it.</p>

                        <p>The first round spent listening doesn't inflict any madness on the listener. The second round requires a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or @UUID[RollTable.pG1sze9DSilZ3uaU]{short-term madness} is the result. The third round requires a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or @UUID[RollTable.9gHUaYaGkrHHRwKO]{long-term madness} results. On the fourth round, the listener automatically gains an @UUID[RollTable.sw6ew0O8F0muvpr4]{indefinite madness} which includes a permanent fear of the <em>Island of the Maw</em>. They will want to leave the island by the quickest possible route. This fear of the island and the indefinite madness are permanent unless cured by @UUID[Item.CrfqCBjK8JdTHLqD]{greater restoration}. If the madness is cured, then the voices will never speak to the listener again.</p>

            <p>This island appears unremarkable until the heroes sail within a mile of the shore. Read the following:</p>

                <p>Your ship approaches another island. Its shoreline is obscured by a strange shimmering in the air. As you sail closer, you feel the ocean currents strengthening below the keel, pulling your vessel into a powerful wind that propels you to an impossible speed. In a matter of moments, the ship sails three times around the island. The sun falls toward the horizon and rapidly sets. The sky soon darkens. As the stars circle above your head, you are overcome with waves of crippling nausea.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">

            <p>On the last journey around the island, each hero must make three DC 15 Constitution saving throws or else they fall &Reference[condition=unconscious] for one minute. Whether the heroes are conscious or not, the ship abruptly slows and floats into a tranquil bay.</p>
            <p>An ancient crumbling dock made from obsidian juts out into the water of the bay. The sky above is filled with more stars than the heroes have ever seen before; heroes with a passive Perception score of 15 or higher will notice that stars occasionally wink out of existence or abruptly transform into bright clouds of light.</p>
            <p>It is always night on the <em>Island of Time</em>. The inhabitants of the island are enigmatic sphinxes. The motivations of these entities is hidden, but they are known to possess great knowledge—it's possible that they know more than any other beings in the world. They also guard strange artifacts on the island.</p>
            <p>Almost all the land is covered in dozens of ruins, consisting of strange buildings made from obsidian, adamantine, and various unknown minerals. The buildings look nothing like those built by human hands: some are shaped like pyramids, while others are obelisks with strange runes and symbols inscribed on every surface. Who or what constructed this place is unknown to anyone—even the gods know nothing of it.</p>

                    <p>Because of the strange nature of time on this island, it is difficult to explore it in a logical fashion, the way the party might explore a dungeon. Instead, the party experiences the island as a series of montages, losing track of time and space while traveling between each area.</p>

                    <p>This island has an ethereal, dream-like quality to it. The heroes may come to believe that they are dreaming rather than awake. As the GM, you should make a show of keeping meticulous track of time on the island. Every minute that passes is counted by the sphinxes and factors into the encounters that trigger.</p>

                    <p>A creature with a woman's face, a feline body, and great feathered wings appears next to you.</p>
                    <p>"I bear your kind no ill will, and I hope you find the knowledge and treasures you seek here,"she says to you in a calm and assuring voice. It's almost like she's continuing a conversation that you forgot you were part of, answering a question you forgot you asked.</p>
                    <p>"But know this: He is coming. If He finds you, He will devour your flesh, your soul, and your very history. Nothing shall remain. Three roars announce His arrival. Three, and no more. This is the time that He has alotted you. Use it wisely."When you look again, the sphinx has vanished. Perhaps she was never there at all.</p>

                    <p>At the highest point of this strange island, you come upon a bizarre dinner party. A massive stone table with a dozen matching chairs stands out in the open. An ogre-sized man sits at the head of the table, fast asleep. His four human-sized guests are much too small for the chairs that they sit in. The humanoids are also asleep. They are almost completely hidden by their hair, which has grown extremely long and unkempt.</p>

                <p>This overlook stands at the top of a 1,000 ft. cliff with jagged rocks below it. The telescope is 20 ft. long, and it is fashioned from bronze. Anyone who looks into it sees the distant city of Mytros.</p>

                    <p>Looking through the telescope, you see the great city of Mytros. The bronze colossus of Pythor stands watch over the bay, which is bustling with merchant ships. Marble and bronze buildings line the city's many busy streets, in the shadow of Mount Volkan.</p>

                    <li class="rd__li ">The third viewing show Mytros a thousand years into the future. The city is under siege by a vast fleet of vessels from the outer world beyond Thylea. Anyone from outside Thylea will recognize some of the flags, but some of the details seem wrong.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">The fourth viewing shows Mytros 10,000 years into the future. The city lies in ruins. Strange, ogre-sized humanoids work in the dust, digging up artifacts from the ruins. The artifacts are corroded shards of the statues of the heroes, unrecognizable with age.</li>

                <p>Your ship is suddenly slammed by a storm gale. Violent waves crash over the deck, and the ship is sucked into a powerful current, leaving your oarsmen helpless. Lightning flashes, illuminating a massive whirlpool just ahead of you. As your ship draws closer, you can see two massive stone hands reaching out of the maelstrom, beckoning you into a broad funnel of water, which leads down into the deepest fathoms of the sea.</p>

            <p>This is <em>Charybdis</em>, an infamous whirlpool known to all Thylean sailors. It is a portal to the Nether Sea that is kept open by two of Kentimane's hands, and it is legendary for swallowing entire ships. By the time the heroes can see <em>Charybdis</em>, the ocean's powerful currents have already started to drag their ship toward the whirlpool.</p>
            <p>Spells such as @UUID[Item.V015OPpBQs1Rw3Uh]{gust of wind}, @UUID[Item.ZL7WqgFEeKjbhJXE]{wind wall}, or a @UUID[Item.IHOcLnH8zSoj5KQD]{conjured air elemental} will allow the character's ship to skirt the whirlpool and avoid it. If magic is not used, then someone must steer the ship with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check. If that fails, then the ship will be sucked into the whirlpool and transported to the Nether Sea. Refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010]{Nether Sea} chapter to continue the adventure.</p>

                <p>Rather than sucking your ship down to the ocean floor, the whirlpool has apparently transported you to a dark, abyssal sea. The waters that now surround you are black and expansive, stretching in all directions under a claustrophobic sky, which is full of strange lights.</p>

            <p>Praxys is the dwelling place of Sydon, the Lord of Storms. It is a great tower of stone, which stands atop a headland of limestone. Sydon's tower projects a piercing ray of light which can be seen from miles away as it sweeps the ocean, searching for trespassers.</p>
            <p>Praxys is located in the Forgotten Sea, but it is much too grand to be detailed here. If the party sets a course for the constellation of the Titan (XVI), then refer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.md72jqAz7B6wF4Hh.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011]{Praxys, Tower of Sydon} chapter to continue the adventure. Reaching the tower should be very difficult.</p>
